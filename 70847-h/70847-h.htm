<p class="center no-indent fs150">THE NEW SPIRIT IN INDIA</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="smcap fs80">Summary of Recent Events</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Although politics are not the only subject of this
book, it may be of assistance if I summarize very
briefly the chief political events of the few years preceding
the winter of 1907-8 when I was in India.</p>

<p>No hard-and-fast line can be drawn in history,
but the arrival of <span class="smcap">Lord Curzon as Viceroy</span> on
December 30th, 1898, marks a fairly strong and
natural division. He had previously been Under-Secretary
for India (1891-92), and Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs (1895-98), and he was well
known for the distinction of his Oxford career and
for his travels in Central Asia, Persia, and the Far
East. In the House of Commons he had further
won a high reputation for industry, knowledge, and
self-reliance.</p>

<p>The first year of his office (1899) was marked
by a change in the <span class="allsmcap">CURRENCY</span>, by which a gold
standard was introduced, gold and currency reserves
instituted, and a permanent rate of exchange fixed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
sixteen pence to the rupee, or fifteen rupees to the
pound sterling—a higher value than the rupee had
reached in the fluctuations of the five previous years.
Before the closing of the mints, it had sunk to 13·1
pence.</p>

<p>In the same year Lord Curzon began his policy
of efficiency by reducing the <span class="smcap">Calcutta Municipality</span>
from seventy-five to fifty, cutting out
twenty-five of the elected members, in spite of strong
protests on the part of the Indian electors.</p>

<p>He also began to earn an enviable unpopularity
among certain classes of Anglo-Indians for his
characteristic vigour in denouncing a British battalion,
some privates of which were believed to have outraged
a native woman to death in <span class="smcap">Rangoon</span> and
remained undetected.</p>

<p>The year 1900 was a season of terrible <span class="allsmcap">FAMINE</span>,
especially in the Central Provinces. About 5,500,000
people came on relief works, and famine was followed
by cholera.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> At the same time the Punjab <span class="smcap">Land
Alienation Act</span> was passed, forbidding the transference
of land to any but agriculturists, the intention
being to prevent the expropriation of peasants by
money-lenders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Welby’s Commission</span> on Indian Expenditure
issued their reports, but the majority report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
suggested no important changes of taxation beyond
the transference of charges amounting to £293,000 a
year to the Imperial Exchequer. Their recommendation
that England should contribute £50,000 to
the expenses of the India Office was not carried out.</p>

<p>In 1901 the <span class="smcap">North-West Frontier Province</span>
was created, and in the following year <span class="smcap">Lord
Kitchener</span> was appointed Commander-in-Chief, the
Education Commission, presided over by Sir Thomas
Raleigh, published its Report (Sir Guru Das Banerjee
writing a Note of Dissent), and the <span class="smcap">Police
Commission</span> began to sit under Sir Andrew Fraser
(afterwards Lieut.-Governor of Bengal).</p>

<p>In the same year Lord Curzon increased his
unpopularity among the class of Anglo-Indians
above mentioned, by punishing the <span class="smcap">9th Lancers</span>,
because at Sialkot two privates were believed to
have beaten to death a native cook who refused to
procure a native woman for them; they remained
undetected.</p>

<p>The next year (1903) opened with a great
<span class="smcap">Durbar at Delhi</span>, the estimated cost of which was
£180,000, and the real cost probably at least
£200,000, apart from the local expenses of provinces
and Native States. The <span class="smcap">Tibet</span> expedition
started in the same year.</p>

<p>More important than either of these events for
the history of India was the <span class="allsmcap">REDUCTION OF THE
SALT TAX</span>, or more properly, the reduction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
price of salt under the Government monopoly.
Between this year and 1907 it was reduced from
2 rupees 8 annas per maund to 1 rupee (a
maund = 82·29 lbs.).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Lord Curzon’s office was now renewed for a
further uncertain term, believed to be two years.
But before his departure for six months’ leave in
1904, he had already reduced his popularity among
the educated classes of India. By the <span class="smcap">Official
Secrets Act</span>, he extended the Acts of 1889 and
1897 so as to include information upon civil affairs
and matters of fact among the offences, as well as
military secrets and newspaper criticism, “likely to
bring the Government or constituted authority into
suspicion or contempt.” As the burden of proof
was thrown on the accused, and it was unnecessary
to establish criminal intention for conviction, this
Act limited newspapers to the supply of such information
as the Government pleased.</p>

<p>In the same year an attempt was made to raise
the standard of higher education by the <span class="smcap">Universities
Act</span>. The main object was to induce the five
Universities of Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Lahore,
and Allahabad to undertake instruction and supervision
as well as examination, to which their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
function had been limited at first. It was laid
down that all students at a University must be
members of an affiliated college, and changes were
introduced into the constitution of the Senates,
which were now to be largely composed of the
Chancellor’s nominees and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-officio</i> members—High
Court Judges, Bishops, members of Executive
Councils, the provincial Directors of Public Instruction,
and professors of Government and missionary
colleges. It was complained that these
provisions destroyed the independence of the Universities,
and, owing to the increased expense, much
reduced the number of students able to compete
for degrees. On the other hand, it is maintained,
and I believe justly, that the standard of learning in
its higher branches has been considerably advanced
since the Act among the affiliated colleges.</p>

<p>A few sentences may be quoted from Lord
Curzon’s <span class="smcap">Budget Speech</span> in March of this year
(1904), as showing his general attitude towards
educated Indians and their demands:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I sympathize most deeply with the aspirations of the
Indians towards greater national unity, and with their desire
to play a part in the public life of the country. But I do
not think that the salvation of India is to be sought on the
field of politics at the present stage of her development....
The highest ranks of civil employment in India must as
a general rule be held by Englishmen, for the reason that
they possess, partly by heredity, partly by up-bringing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
partly by education, the knowledge of the principles of
government, the habits of mind, the vigour of character,
which are essential for the task, and that, the rule of India
being a British rule, and every other rule being in the
circumstances of the case impossible, the tone and standard
should be set by those who have created and are responsible
for it.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He further went on to maintain that on salaries of
£800 a year and upward, 1263 government servants
were Europeans, 15 Eurasians, and 92 Indians;
while on salaries between £60 and £800, there
were 5205 Europeans, 5420 Eurasians, and 16,283
Indians. These figures were, however, severely
analysed by Mr. Gokhale in his Budget speech of
1905.</p>

<p>It was held by educated Indians that a Government
Resolution of May 24, 1904, carrying this
statement of policy into effect, tended to exclude
Indians from the higher branches of the service, and
stood in contradiction to <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria’s Proclamation</span>
for India in 1858, in which occur the
following two clauses:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian
territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us
to all our other subjects; and those obligations we shall
faithfully and conscientiously fulfil.</p>

<p>“And it is our further will that, so far as may be, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
subjects, of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially
admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they
may be qualified, by their education, ability, and integrity,
duly to discharge.”</p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, at the meeting of the National
Congress in Bombay at the end of this year, the first
resolution was in protest against the <span class="smcap">exclusion of
Indians</span> from the higher grades of the Service. The
other resolutions, showing the tendency of the time,
included protests against the increasing military
expenditure, especially upon the Tibet expedition,
and demands for wider education, technical schools,
a Permanent Land Settlement, police reform in
accordance with the Commission of 1903, the separation
of judicial and executive functions throughout
the Civil Service, simultaneous examinations for the
Service in England and India, and part payment by
England of the cost of the India Office in Whitehall.
<span class="smcap">Sir Henry Cotton</span>, Chief Commissioner of Assam
from 1896 to 1902, was President of the Congress
that year, and he was deputed to lay the resolutions
before the Viceroy in person. But Lord Curzon
refused to receive him.</p>

<p>On February 11, 1905, Lord Curzon addressed
the <span class="smcap">Convocation of Calcutta University</span> with a
dissertation upon truthfulness and other virtues—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I hope I am making no false or arrogant claim,” he
said, “when I say that the highest ideal of truth is to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
large extent a Western conception. I do not thereby mean
to claim that Europeans are universally or even generally
truthful, still less do I mean that Asiatics deliberately or
habitually deviate from the truth. The one proposition
would be absurd, the other insulting. But undoubtedly
truth took a high place in the moral codes of the West
before it had been similarly honoured in the East, where
craftiness and diplomatic wile have always been held in
much repute. We may prove it by the common innuendo
that lurks in the words ‘Oriental diplomacy,’ by which is
meant something rather tortuous and hypersubtle. The
same may be seen in Oriental literature. In your epics
truth will often be extolled as a virtue; but quite as often it
is attended with some qualification, and very often praise is
given to successful deception practised with honest aim.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Viceroy, addressing his Bengali audience,
went on to say that “he knew no country where
mare’s-nests were more prolific than here”; and he
warned them especially against flattery and vituperation,
and afterwards against eloquence.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“In India,” he said, “there are two sets of people, the
reticent and the eloquent. I dare say you know to which
class the people in this part of the country belong. I am
sometimes lost in admiration at the facility with which they
speak in a foreign language, and I envy the accomplishment.
All I say to you is, do not presume upon this talent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the conclusion of the speech, he introduced
the following sentences:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Learn that the true salvation of India will not come
from without, but must be created within. It will not be
given you by enactment of the British Parliament, or of any
Parliament at all.... Be true Indians—that is the prompting
of nationality.... In India I see the claim constantly
advanced that a man is not merely a Bengali, or an Uriya,
or a Mahratta, or a Sikh, but a member of the Indian nation.
I do not think it can yet be said that there is any Indian
nation, though in the distant future some approach to it
may be evolved. However that may be, the Indian is most
certainly a member of the British Empire.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Neither these contradictory remarks on nationality,
nor the Viceroy’s well-intentioned exposition
of the national tendency to deceit, were received by
the audience and their friends in a properly chastened
spirit. But the <em>Amrita Bazar Patrika</em>, next to the
<em>Bengalee</em>, perhaps the most influential Indian paper
in Calcutta, contented itself with the following
extract from Lord Curzon’s book, called “Problems
of the Far East” (p. 155 of the edition quoted),
where, writing of his conversation with the President
of the Korean Foreign Office, he said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Having been warned not to say I was only thirty-three,
when he put me the straight question, ‘How old are you?’
I unhesitatingly responded, ‘Forty.’ ‘I presume you are a
near relative of the Queen of England?’ (asked the President).
‘No,’ I replied, ‘I am not.’ But I was fain to add, ‘I am,
however, as yet an unmarried man,’ with which unscrupulous
suggestion I completely regained the old gentleman’s favour.”</p>
</div>

<p>The quotation was regarded as apt, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
passage was only a joke, and it must be remembered
that Lord Curzon had not claimed that Europeans
are universally or even generally truthful. He had
called that proposition absurd.</p>

<p>The speech itself would probably have been soon
forgotten if it had not been connected in the popular
mind with the greatest and most disastrous of Lord
Curzon’s schemes for promoting his ideal of efficiency—the
<span class="smcap">Partition of Bengal</span>.</p>

<p>It had long been evident that the Province of
Bengal, if the large outlying districts of Orissa,
Behar, and Chota Nagpur were included, was too
large for one administration. It contained close upon
80,000,000 souls. But of this amount Bengal
Proper counted for only 43,000,000. The next
largest of the districts was Behar, with 21,500,000.
Two things were possible and would have been
gladly accepted—either to form a new province out
of the western districts of Behar, Chota Nagpur,
and Orissa, with a capital at Patna or Ranchi,
relieving Bengal of a population of about 33,000,000;
or to have elevated Bengal into a Governorship
on the same standing as Bombay and Madras,
under a Governor appointed directly from England
instead of a Lieut.-Governor appointed out of the
Indian Civil Service; and at the same time to have
organized the outlying districts as Commissionerships,
responsible either to the Crown, or to the
Governor of Bengal. Either of these two main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
schemes would have been accepted without question
by the enormous majority of the inhabitants, and
the chief principles of the second were favoured
by Mr. Brodrick (Lord Midleton), at that time
Secretary of State for India.</p>

<p>Lord Curzon, however, was determined to cut
Bengal Proper and the Bengali-speaking community
in two, giving 25,000,000 of the population to the
new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam with a
new capital at Dacca, and 18,000,000 of the population
to a Province still to be called Bengal, with
the old capital of Calcutta, and bound up with the
outlying districts of Behar, Chota Nagpur, and
Orissa, all of which differ from Bengal in race,
language, and civilization, as does Assam. Under
this division, the populations of the two new Provinces
are approximately 54,000,000 in Bengal, and
31,000,000 in Eastern Bengal and Assam.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>When Partition on these lines was first proposed,
it excited strong protest, not only among
the Hindu population of Bengal, but among many
Civil Servants and Anglo-Indian papers, also among
the Mohammedans of Eastern Bengal, who are
Bengalis by race, but number three-fifths of the
population, and, therefore, might be expected to
welcome the change, especially as they were
promised considerable advantages under the new
administration. Large numbers of public meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
were held throughout Bengal to protest against the
measure, and petitions were sent to the British
Parliament. As the British authorities paid no
attention to these representations, the “Swadeshi”
(literally “Our own Country”) movement was
started for the exclusive use of native productions,
in the hope that a boycott on British goods might at
last induce public opinion in England to take notice
of an Indian grievance. As Mr. John Morley said,
when speaking as Secretary of State for India in the
House of Commons, February 26, 1906: “I am
bound to say, nothing was ever worse done in
disregard to the feeling and opinion of the majority
of the people concerned.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lord Curzon accomplished the
Partition by an unexpected <span class="smcap">Proclamation</span> from
Simla on September 1, 1905, appointing Sir
Andrew Fraser Lieut.-Governor in Calcutta, and
Sir Bampfylde Fuller Lieut.-Governor in Dacca,
both being entire strangers to Bengal. The
Partition came into force on October 16, 1905—a
day observed as a fast of humiliation and prayer
throughout the Provinces.</p>

<p>In the same month <span class="smcap">Mr. Gokhale</span> and <span class="smcap">Lala
Lajpat Rai</span> came to England as Congress
Delegates, to lay the demands of the constitutional
reform party before English audiences. Lala Lajpat
Rai also visited America.</p>

<p>Before the Partition was proclaimed, Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Curzon had submitted his <span class="allsmcap">RESIGNATION</span> (August
12, 1905), owing to a difference of opinion with
Lord Kitchener over the appointment of a new
“Military Supply Member” to the Viceroy’s
Council; and, in reality, over the position of the
Commander-in-Chief and the Military Supply
Member with regard to the Governor-General in
Council. The difference does not concern us,
except that, as the Conservative Home Government
supported Lord Kitchener’s view, and thus drove
Lord Curzon to resign, it was widely believed that
Mr. Brodrick accepted the Partition the more readily
as a salve to Lord Curzon’s feelings.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Minto</span> was at once appointed to
succeed, but Lord Curzon remained to nearly the
end of the year, partly in order to welcome the
Prince and Princess of Wales on their visit to
India. In his farewell speech at Simla (September 30,
1905) he said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“If I were asked to sum up my work in a single word,
I would say ‘Efficiency.’ That has been our gospel, the
keynote of our administration.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No one has questioned his industry and personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
devotion. During his seven years’ tenure, he instituted
Commissions on plague, famine, irrigation,
universities, and police; he organized departments
of Commerce and Industry, and of Imperial
Customs; he endeavoured to introduce elasticity
into the Land Assessment; he revolutionized our
Frontier policy; and he did more for the preservation
of Indian history, architecture, and ancient memorials
than any of his predecessors. All this in addition
to the other changes and undertakings mentioned
above.</p>

<p>The appointment of <span class="smcap">Mr. John Morley</span> to the
India Office (December, 1905) was received with
the utmost enthusiasm by the country, but, unfortunately,
Lord Curzon’s industrious devotion to
efficiency, without consideration of the prejudices or
reasonable desires of the people concerned, had sown
the seed for the irritation and disturbances of the
next two years. The first signs of unrest naturally
appeared in Eastern Bengal, where the <span class="smcap">Swadeshi</span>
movement had been instituted as a protest against
the Partition. <span class="smcap">Sir Bampfylde Fuller</span> found himself
at once involved in difficulties about the boycott
of foreign goods, public meetings, and the participation
of schoolboys and students in the political
questions that occupied all minds. On April 14,
1906, the Bengal Provincial Conference was dispersed
with violence by the police at Barisal.
Bodies of punitive police and Gurkhas were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
quartered in several small towns and villages at their
expense. Schools were deprived of their grants
and the right to compete for scholarships. A
circular was issued curtailing the right of public
meeting, and suppressing processions and the cry
of “Bande Mataram.” In another circular Sir
Bampfylde Fuller laid it down that a fixed proportion
of Government posts should be reserved for
Mohammedans, and, until that proportion had been
reached, no qualified Mohammedan candidate should
be rejected in favour of a Hindu candidate, merely
because the latter had superior qualifications (May
25, 1906). Finally, owing to some petty disturbances
by schoolboys at Serajganj, in the Pabna
district (November 15, 1905), the Lieut.-Governor
who had already severely punished the two schools
in the place, and posted punitive police there,
demanded that they should be disaffiliated from
Calcutta University. The Government asked him
to reconsider the case, and he resigned (August 4,
1906), being succeeded by Sir Lancelot Hare.</p>

<p>The next month was marked by a characteristic
description of a simple incident by Calcutta correspondents
to the English press. On September 5th
<span class="smcap">Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea</span>, twice President
of the National Congress and now editor of the
<cite>Bengalee</cite> newspaper in Calcutta, was honoured by
a common Indian ceremony of “benediction” in
a private house. It was an affair of an umbrella,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
a chaplet, garlands, and the recitation of verses from
the Vedas. It is almost impossible for even a
casual visitor to India to escape a score of very
similar performances. Yet the correspondents on
whom England chiefly depends for Indian news
described this as a solemn <span class="allsmcap">CORONATION</span> of Mr.
Banerjea as India’s Emperor, as if to rouse the
suspicions and rage of the English people into
sensational panic.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1907, local disturbances occurred
in Eastern Bengal and the Punjab. Meetings to
protest against the Partition had been continually
held in Eastern Bengal, and in the first week of
March the Nawab Salimulla of Dacca visited the
small town of <span class="smcap">Comilla</span> in order to encourage counter-demonstrations
on the part of the Mohammedans,
over whom he claimed great influence. During his
visit small riots took place between Hindu and Mohammedan
crowds; a Mohammedan was killed and
one or two Hindus. By one means or another, the
report was circulated through the country that the
Indian Government was favouring the Mohammedan
population and would inflict no punishment for the
looting of Hindu shops or the abduction of Hindu
women, especially widows. Accordingly, shops
were looted, Hindu widows abducted, and the cases
of outrage upon women by gangs increased in
number.</p>

<p>In the third week of April further disturbances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
broke out at <span class="smcap">Jamalpur</span>, another small town in
Eastern Bengal, where the Hindus, during a festival,
were set upon by Mohammedan rowdies, who desecrated
a temple and maintained panic in the district
for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The troubles that arose in the <span class="smcap">Punjab</span>, about the
same time, were largely agricultural in origin. There
had been a large increase in the land-assessment,
together with a sudden rise in the irrigation rates,
especially on the Bari-Doab canal. The Punjab
Legislative Council had also brought forward a
<span class="smcap">Colonization Bill</span> altering the agreements by which
colonists held reclaimed land, especially in the Chenab
Colony, under the Act of 1893. Many relations of
these tenants were enlisted in Sikh and other Indian
regiments, and ultimately Lord Minto withheld his
consent from the Bill. The question of the irrigation
dues was also postponed for a year.</p>

<p>Meantime, Indian opinion was constantly irritated
by the abuse and ridicule poured upon educated
Indians in the “<span class="smcap">Civil and Military Gazette</span>,”
the leading Anglo-Indian paper of Lahore. They
were spoken of as “babbling B.A.’s,” “base-born
B.A.’s,” “an unhonoured nobility of the school,”
“serfs,” “beggars on horseback,” “servile classes,”
“a class that carries a stigma,” and so on. When
petitioned twice to put an end to this kind of
journalism as stirring up strife between the races,
Sir Denzil Ibbetson, at that time Lieut.-Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of the Punjab, regretted the tone of the articles but
refused to prosecute.</p>

<p>On the other hand, two Indian papers in Lahore
were prosecuted—“<span class="smcap">India</span>” for republishing a letter
from America containing a seditious appeal to the
native troops, and the “<span class="smcap">Punjabee</span>” for its comments
on a case of “Begar,” or forced labour, which was
supposed to have led to the death of two villagers
compelled to work for an official. In the case of
<em>India</em>, the proprietor and editor, Pindi Das, was sentenced
to five years’ imprisonment, and the printer,
Dina Nath, to two years. In the <em>Punjabee</em> case,
the proprietor, Lala Jaswant Rai, was sentenced, on
appeal, to a fine of 1000 rupees and six months’ imprisonment,
and the editor, K. K. Athavale, to a fine
of 200 rupees and six months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>After the judgment of the Chief Court on appeal
was given in the <em>Punjabee</em> case (April 16, 1907),
the prisoners on their way to gaol were met by
an enthusiastic crowd, and there was some disturbance,
for which three young men were arrested.</p>

<p>This disturbance was followed by a more serious
riot at <span class="smcap">Rawal Pindi</span>, the greatest military cantonment
of the north-west district of India (May 2nd).
In the previous February a young and then unknown
Indian, named <span class="smcap">Ajit Singh</span>, had started an “Indian
Patriots’ Association,” chiefly to deal with the agricultural
grievances above mentioned. Various meetings
were held, and at Lyallpur (March 22nd) <span class="smcap">Lala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Lajpat Rai</span>, who had no connection with the Association,
but was well known in Lahore as a religious
and social reformer in the Arya Samaj, addressed an
agricultural audience, in a speech in which he ventured
to declare that officials are servants of the
public. Ajit Singh also spoke, and this was the only
occasion on which the two men were on the same
platform.</p>

<p>Meetings were held at Rawal Pindi, on April
7th and 21st. On the latter day Ajit Singh made a
violent attack upon the increase of land assessment,
calling on the peasants to cease cultivation until the
amount was reduced. Mr. Hansraj Sawhny, a
prominent pleader, in the chair, checked the speaker,
who went away in a rage. But shortly afterwards,
Mr. Agnew, the Deputy Commissioner, summoned
the chairman and two other lawyers, for an enquiry
into the matter. On the very morning of the
enquiry, the proceedings were postponed, owing to a
telegram from Sir Denzil Ibbetson, and the large
crowd which had collected, instead of dispersing,
swept down a main road, destroyed and burnt some
furniture from a mission house and church, and
damaged some gardens and houses of Europeans,
together with a Hindu workshop, where the men
were on strike. The police did not appear, but
troops patrolled the town later.</p>

<p>For this riot, six prominent lawyers were arrested
and kept in gaol, no bail being allowed, through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
hot weather from May 3rd to October 1st, when
they were acquitted and discharged, the magistrate
declaring the evidence was fabricated. In consequence
of this unmerited imprisonment, one of
them has since died.</p>

<p>About sixty other persons were arrested, and five
were condemned, three of them to seven years’ imprisonment
for riot and arson. The trial took place
before Mr. A. E. Martineau, Sessions Judge of
Delhi, as Special Magistrate, and the terms of his
judgment did much to restore Indian confidence in
British justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak
of the Mutiny</span> (May 10th), had been fixed by some
Anglo-Indian journalists as the date for a probable
rising against the British, and, owing to their warnings,
preparations were made for withdrawing the
British residents, especially in the Punjab towns,
into the forts. But in spite of all that prophecy
could do, no outbreak occurred.</p>

<p>However, on May 9th, Lala Lajpat Rai was suddenly
<span class="allsmcap">DEPORTED</span> from Lahore without notice, charge,
or trial, and conveyed to the fort in Mandalay.
Ajit Singh was similarly deported from Amritsar.</p>

<p>When questioned in the Commons as to this
breach of “Habeas Corpus,” Mr. John Morley
pleaded the powers of deportation granted by a
<span class="smcap">Regulation of 1818</span>, under which thirty-two
persons were at the moment detained in restraint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>On May 11th, Lord Minto issued a <span class="smcap">Proclamation</span>
limiting the <span class="allsmcap">RIGHT OF PUBLIC MEETING</span>
in parts of the Punjab and Eastern Bengal. Under
this Ordinance seven days’ written notice was required
before a meeting, the meeting might be
prohibited by a magistrate, and the police were
to attend.</p>

<p>On May 27th, the Viceroy refused his assent to
the Punjab Colonization Bill above described.</p>

<p>Meantime, on behalf of the Home Department
of the Government of India, <span class="smcap">Sir Herbert Risley</span>
issued a <span class="smcap">Circular</span> with regard to the political
behaviour of schoolboys, teachers, students, and
professors (May 6th). It ordained that where
schoolboys associated themselves with political
movements grants-in-aid should be withdrawn from
the school, and the privilege of competing for
scholarships withheld; universities were not to
recognize the school, nor to admit its candidates to
matriculation. Schoolmasters were allowed by the
Circular “to have a right to their own opinions as
much as any one else,” but should be visited by
“disciplinary action” if their utterances endangered
the orderly development of the boys, or were subversive
of their respect for authority. In the case
of colleges, students were allowed to attend meetings,
but if they became active in politics, the
privileges of affiliation should be withdrawn. Professors
were permitted more latitude, but if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
encouraged students to attend political meetings, the
university or the Government should intervene.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Budget</span> for the year 1907-8 was estimated
at £75,012,800 revenue, and £74,238,100 expenditure,
giving a surplus of £774,700. In his Budget
speech of June 6th, Mr. John Morley made the
important announcement that <span class="smcap">two nominated
Indians</span> were to be added to the <span class="smcap">India Council</span> in
Whitehall, and gave the names of Mr. K. G. Gupta,
as representing the Hindus, and Mr. S. H. Bilgrami,
as representing the Mohammedans.</p>

<p>At the same time he announced a <span class="allsmcap">SCHEME OF
REFORMS</span>, proposed by the Indian Government at
Simla, to be submitted to the Local Governments
for criticism. In brief, the scheme included:—</p>

<p>(1) The institution of an “Imperial Advisory
Council,” consisting of about sixty members, all
appointed by the Viceroy, including twenty ruling
chiefs, “with a suitable number of territorial
magnates of every province where landholders of
sufficient dignity and status are to be found.” This
council was to be summoned at the Viceroy’s pleasure,
and to hold nothing but private, informal, and
confidential meetings, having no legislative powers
of any sort.</p>

<p>(2) Provincial Advisory Councils—apparently
seven—of smaller size, but consisting of the local
Imperial Councillors and representatives of lesser
landholders, industry, commerce, capital, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
professional classes, all nominated by the head of
the Local Government; their functions also to be
entirely consultative.</p>

<p>(3) The enlargement of the Viceroy’s Legislative
Council from twenty-four to fifty-three by the inclusion
of more Viceroy’s nominees, two representatives
of the Chambers of Commerce, two Mohammedans
elected by rotation from Mohammedan districts,
seven landholders elected by the landed magnates,
and seven instead of four members elected by the
non-official members of the Legislative Councils.
The last point may appear like a concession to
popular representation, but seven out of fifty-three
is not so powerful a fraction as four out of
twenty-four.</p>

<p>(4) The enlargement of the Provincial Legislative
Councils, but this proposal was left vague,
beyond a few suggestions.</p>

<p>Some miscellaneous points in the history of the
year remain to be noticed.</p>

<p>The official return of deaths from <span class="allsmcap">PLAGUE</span> during
the first four months of the year (1907) amounted
to 642,000, and the total deaths from plague since
its first appearance in 1896 up to April, 1907, were
5,250,000.</p>

<p>On August 7th, and again on October 2nd,
disturbances arose in College Square and Beadon
Square in Calcutta, and in the same city a popular
speaker named <span class="smcap">Bepin Chandra Pal</span> was sentenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
to six months’ imprisonment (September 11th) for
refusing to give evidence in the prosecution of the
Indian paper, <cite>Bande Mataram</cite>. When summoned
as witness before the magistrate, Mr. Kingsford, he
replied:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I have conscientious objections against taking part in
a prosecution which I believe to be unjust and injurious to
the cause of popular freedom and the interests of public
peace.” (August 26.)</p>
</div>

<p>Two special commissions were instituted in the
autumn—a <span class="smcap">Decentralization Commission</span>, under
Mr. Charles Hobhouse, at that time Under-Secretary
for India, and a <span class="smcap">Factory Labour Commission</span>,
under Mr. W. T. Morrison of the Bombay Civil
Service. They sat in various parts of India during
the winter.</p>

<p>In July an agreement was announced with China,
by which it was ultimately arranged that China
should regard 51,000 chests of <span class="allsmcap">OPIUM</span> exported from
India as a standard amount, this amount to be
decreased yearly by one-tenth from 1908 till it
disappeared in ten years, provided that China made
similar reductions in her produce.</p>

<p>On August 31st an <span class="smcap">Anglo-Russian Agreement</span>
was signed, dividing Persia into Russian and British
spheres of influence, with a neutral zone between;
Afghanistan was recognized as outside Russian influence,
and both Powers agreed not to send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
representatives to Lhassa. In some quarters it was
hoped that this Agreement would warrant a large
reduction in the military expenditure of India.</p>

<p>In October <span class="smcap">Sir George Clarke</span>, lately Secretary
to the Committee of Imperial Defence, arrived from
England as new Governor of Bombay. In the
same month <span class="smcap">Mr. Keir Hardie</span>, ex-leader of the
Labour Party in the Commons, visited Eastern
Bengal, where his private statements and conversation
were misrepresented by correspondents to
the English newspapers and agencies as seditious
speeches.</p>

<p>On November 1st a <span class="smcap">Seditious Meetings Act</span>
was passed by the Viceroy in Council at Simla,
giving Local Governments the power to “proclaim”
the whole or part of their provinces, in which case
seven days’ notice in writing must be given of
every public meeting, including the assembly of
twenty persons or over in a private house; the
District Magistrate, or Commissioner of Police was
given power to prohibit such a meeting, or to direct
that police should be present.</p>

<p>Mr. Gokhale and Dr. Rash Behari Ghose spoke
strongly in opposition to the Bill as Indian representatives
on the Council, and the Tikka Sahib of
Nabha, a Sikh representative of the Punjab, joined
them in voting against the measure, which was
carried by a majority of nine British against three
Indians, no other members of Council being able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to attend, as the session was in Simla contrary to
precedent for important legislation.</p>

<p>The next week brought the full text of Mr.
John Morley’s speech to his constituents at Arbroath,
in defence of his Indian policy. I quote the
following sentences on account of the attention they
attracted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Does any one want me to go to London to-morrow
morning and to send a telegram to Lord Kitchener, and tell
him to disband the Indian Army, and send home as fast as
we can dispatch transports the British contingent of the Army,
and bring away the whole of the Civil Servants?... How
should we look in the face of the civilized world if we had
turned our back upon our duty and upon our task? How
should we bear the savage stings of our own consciences
when, as assuredly we should, we heard through the dark
distances the roar and scream of confusion and carnage in
India?”</p>
</div>

<p>Speaking of Mr. Keir Hardie and one of his
reported sayings in Eastern Bengal, Mr. Morley
said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I am not at all sure that he said this, but it does not
matter, because many other people have said it—That whatever
is good in the way of self-government for Canada must
be good for India. In my view that is the most concise
statement that I can imagine, and the grossest fallacy in all
politics.... You might just as well say that, because a fur
coat in Canada at certain times of the year is a most comfortable
garment, therefore a fur coat in the Deccan of India
is a sort of handy garment that you might be very happy to
wear.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>A few sentences further on he added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I hope that the Government of India, so long as I am
connected with it and responsible for it to Parliament and to
the country, will not be hurried by the anger of the impatient
idealist. The impatient idealist—you know him, I know
him, I like him; I have been one myself. He says, ‘You
admit that so and so is right, why don’t you do it? why
don’t you do it now?’ Ah, gentlemen, how many of the
most tragic miscarriages in human history have been due
to the impatience of the idealist?</p>

<p>“... You would not have me see men set the prairie
on fire without arresting the hand. You would not blame
me when I saw some men smoking their pipes near powder
magazines—you would not call me an arch-coercionist
if I said, ‘Away with the men, and away with the powder.’”</p>
</div>

<p>In answer to those who said India was astonished
at the licence extended to newspapers and speakers,
he continued:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Orientals, they say, do not understand it. But we are
not Orientals; that is the root of the matter. We English,
Scotch, and Irish are in India because we are not Orientals....
We are representatives, not of Oriental civilization
but Western civilization, of its methods, its principles, its
practices; and I for one will not be hurried into an excessive
haste for repression by the argument that Orientals do not
understand this toleration.</p>

<p>“Anybody who has read history knows that the Extremist
beats the Moderate by his fire, his fiery energy, his very
narrowness and concentration. But still we hold that it
would be the height of political folly for us at this moment
to refuse to do all we can to rally the Moderates to the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of the Government, simply because the policy will not satisfy
the Extremists. Let us, if we can, rally the Moderates, and,
if we are told that the policy will not satisfy the Extremists,
so be it; our line will remain the same.</p>

<p>“... Some of them (the leaders of unrest) are angry with
me. Why? Because I have not been able to give them the
moon. I have got no moon, and if I had I would not give
them the moon.</p>

<p>“... I am not surprised that these educated Indians who
read these great masters and teachers of ours (Milton, Burke,
Macaulay, and Mill) are intoxicated with the ideas of freedom
and nationality and self-government which these great
writers promulgate. Who of us can wonder who had the
privilege in the days of our youth, at college or at home, of
turning over these golden pages and seeing that lustrous
firmament dome over our youthful imaginations—who of us
can forget the intoxication and rapture with which we made
friends with these truths?... I only say this to my idealist
friends, whether Indian or European, that for every passage
they can find in the speeches or writings of these great
teachers of wisdom, I will find them a dozen passages in
which, in the language of Burke, the warning is given—‘How
weary a step do those take who endeavour to make
out of a great mass a true political personality!’”</p>
</div>

<p>After referring to a saying about Sir Henry
Lawrence, that “no one ever sat at his table without
learning to think more kindly of the natives,” Mr.
Morley added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“India is perhaps the one country—bad manners, overbearing
manners are very disagreeable in all countries—India
is the only country where bad and overbearing manners are
a political crime.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the summer there had
been some local riots and disturbances in Southern
India because at <span class="smcap">Cocanada</span>, on the coast north of
Madras, an Englishman was accused of having beaten
a Hindu boy for shouting “Bande Mataram.” He
was sentenced to a small fine (£10, including
damages), and was acquitted on appeal. But this
autumn, unhappily, Indian opinion was further inflamed
by the results of two trials in private cases
held before British juries in the Punjab. In <span class="smcap">Lahore</span>
a British journalist was accused of having shot his
bearer dead, after kicking him out of the house,
revolver in hand, and was sentenced to six months’
imprisonment, the jury finding that death was accidental.
In the other case, at <span class="smcap">Rawal Pindi</span>, a
British assistant station-master and a Mohammedan
porter admitted to having in turn outraged a
Hindu woman, who was waiting for a train and
was enticed into the stationmaster’s room by
threats and pretended information about a telegram.
Both were acquitted by the jury on a plea of
“consent.”</p>

<p>In November of this year, Mr. Dadabhai
Naoroji, veteran champion of India’s cause before
the English people, returned to spend his last days
in a quiet place on the coast near Bombay. Born
a Bombay Parsi in 1825, he had first gone to live
in England just before the Mutiny, but had often
returned to official or other work in Baroda and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Bombay. He was a member of the first Indian
National Congress at its inauguration in Bombay
(1885), and in the next year stood as Liberal
candidate for Holborn, on which occasion Lord
Salisbury told the electors he could not believe they
would vote for a “black man.” Nevertheless, he
was Liberal member for Central Finsbury from
1892 to 1895, being the first Indian in the House
of Commons. In 1892 he was President of the
Congress held at Lahore, and in 1906, in spite of
his great age, he consented to be President of the
Congress held at Calcutta, because it was felt that
the reverence with which he was regarded by all
Indians would avert the danger of open rupture
between the moderate and extremist parties.</p>

<p>This bare summary of events may, perhaps, be
useful for reference, and I think it will enable
readers of the following pages better to understand
the subjects of public interest that were occupying
the attention of educated Indians and of Anglo-Indians
when I arrived at Bombay in October,
1907, as correspondent for the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>
and other papers.</p>

<p>I owe my hearty thanks to all Anglo-Indian
and Indian officials and friends who gave me ungrudging
assistance during my visit, and especially
to Mr. S. K. Ratcliffe, lately editor of the <cite>Statesman</cite>
in Calcutta, for reading my proofs and giving me
the advantage of his exceptional knowledge.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It was the Indian festival of Diwali, held at Poona on
Guy Fawkes’ Day, and celebrated with innumerable
flames, like our own thanksgiving for the protection
of King and Parliament. But, in feeling, the Diwali
comes nearer to Christmastide, for it has no political
significance, and the flames are not lighted as a
defiance to the Pope of Rome, but in honour of
Lakshmi, the goddess of family prosperity, who
provides wealth sufficient for us, and holds a baby
to the breast above her heart.</p>

<p>So brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces,
cousins to the tenth removal, were gathered together
in the joy of a kinship that regards the
smallest trace of common blood as absolute and
unquestioned claim to lifelong support under a
common roof. No Workhouse or Industrial School
for them! As long as one of the kin has pancakes
and a cow, there is always a certainty of a crumb
and a sup of milk all round. In honour of such
riches and family love, the ceilings of the rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and the verandahs fluttered with pink and yellow
flags; the windows and doors were hung with
festoons of orange marigolds on a string; upon
the entrance pavement neat patterns in whitewash
were drawn by hand-rollers; and, as the streets
turned blue with evening, the children, draped in
all the gorgeous crimsons and golds their mothers
could afford, lighted the tiny oil lamps on window-sill
and doorstep, or threw the spurting fires under
the very noses of sacred bulls that wander for their
living from shop to shop. To be sure, other helpful
powers beside Lakshmi have a share in the
honour (for who can tell under which form he
loves God best?), and it is the temples of Durga
and Vishnu, of Siva and Parvati, lady of the far-off
mountain snow, that make the sacred hill of
Parbati outside the city sparkle like an illuminated
birthday cake, for at least one night during the
Diwali feast of brotherhood.</p><br>

<p>The sad thing was that in the beautiful streets
where Mahratta nobles had built their simple palaces
under the Peshwas a century ago, many of the houses
now stood dark and empty, in terror of the plague.
Hardly eleven years had passed since the pestilence
first appeared, imported from Hongkong as people
thought, and in those eleven years it had killed nearly
six millions of India’s inhabitants. Six millions out of
three hundred millions may not sound very much; it
is only two in every hundred spread over eleven years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>But the loss was not equally distributed, and when I
was told that within those eleven years the inhabitants
of Poona had been reduced to nearly one-third,
I knew why so many homes were dark on a night of
lamps and family affection. At the time, the plague
was striking down from twelve to fifteen, or at the
highest twenty, so that its visitation was regarded as
light. But I remember the panic when a single case
was reported in London, or even at the more comfortable
distance of Marseilles, and so it was natural
to find that many families had gone to live on
selected open spaces outside the city. There among
rocks and withered grass they kindled their little
lamps and celebrated family joy in any hut of wicker,
matting, canvas, petroleum tins, old boxes, boards,
or branches which they and the Imperial Government
could manage to rig up between them. Many shopmen
had even transferred their little stores of grain,
sweets, and cottons to this countrified scene, and the
general effect was like a scrappy Derby Day without
the races.</p>

<p>Having crossed a bridge, to the left of which thin
columns of smoke still rose from the smouldering
bodies of yesterday’s dead, I passed through one of
these Health Camps, as official language fondly calls
them, and found before me a partly finished building
of solid stone—unfinished, but with something
already monastic and grave in its straight-roofed hall
and line of cloistral habitations. It was the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
home of the “Servants of India Society,” and in
front of his own small house the founder and “First
Member” of the Society was standing to receive me.</p>

<p>Mr. Gopal Krishna Gokhale is one of the very
few Indians whose name is known in England to a
certain number of people outside the score or two
that pay attention to Indian affairs. Born a Mahratta
Brahman of the highest caste and of ordinary poverty
in the small town of Kolhapur, he threw away the
caste and retained the poverty. While a student at
the Elphinstone College in Bombay, he came under
the influence of Justice Ranade, also a Mahratta
Brahman and judge of the High Court, famous
already for social reform, and at that time combining
with others to establish the National Congress, which
held its first meeting in 1885. Mr. Gokhale had
taken his degree the year before. Lord Ripon had
just left the country, honoured and regretted among
Indians as no other Viceroy has been, and the air
was full of schemes for political emancipation under
the favour and encouragement of British statesmen.
Among the reformers of that time, when all were
moderate, Ranade was distinguished for moderation,
and when Mr. Gokhale in his student days chose
him as his “guru,” or spiritual guide, he fixed for
life his own characteristics of moderation, and a
certain sweet reasonableness, not only of manner,
but of aim.</p>

<p>It is common to say of a dead politician that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>he was devoted heart and soul to the service of
his country, and, happily, it is sometimes true,
even though that devoted service has been crowned
by honours, fame, and riches. But of Mr. Gokhale
who is still alive, I would say that for every day
of his manhood he has had no motive but his
country’s service, from the day of his appointment
on a salary of £60 a year as teacher of
history and economics at the Fergusson College in
Poona up to his retirement in 1902 on a pension
of £20 a year, and onward through the last six
years of labour, vilification, and heated controversy.
Not a great speaker, and making no attempt at
emotional eloquence at a time when oratory counted
for much more in India than it does now—a man
who has never even contemplated any popular arts
except his own inevitable politeness, he has won
his influence upon his country’s future simply by
unreserved devotion and integrity of life. At a
moment of intense excitement during the plague
riots in Poona, when Mr. Rand and Lieut. Ayerst
were shot by Damodar Chapekar and his brothers
as they drove into the city from Government House
(June 22, 1897), he, being then in England,
published charges against the method of plague-observation
by British soldiers, which on his return
he discovered were not supported by the promised
evidence, and he offered an open apology to Lord
Sandhurst and the Army. Amidst an infuriated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
public opinion, which believed the charges to be not
only true, but below the truth, few could have lived
down such a retractation. But Mr. Gokhale lived
it down.</p>

<p>When the National Congress met at Benares in
December, 1905, just after the partition of Bengal,
he was elected President as the safest guide in a
crisis of extreme difficulty and increasing indignation.
Mr. John Morley had just received his
appointment to the India Office, and a few lines
from Mr. Gokhale’s presidential address may be
quoted to show the hopes and fears of the time:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Large numbers of educated men in this country feel
towards Mr. Morley as towards a Master, and the heart
hopes and yet trembles. He, the reverent student of Burke,
the disciple of Mill, the friend and biographer of Gladstone,
will he courageously apply their principles and his own to
the government of this country, or will he too succumb
to the influences of the India Office, and thus cast a blight
on hopes which his own writings have done so much to
foster? In any case his appointment indicates how favourable
to our cause the attitude of the new Ministry is.”</p>
</div>

<p>For two or three years past Mr. Gokhale had
represented the Presidency of Bombay as one of
the elected Indians upon the Viceroy’s Legislative
Council, and when I first met him at Poona, as I
have described, he had just returned from the
Council at Simla, in which the Seditious Meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Bill was approved.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Before the Viceroy and the
rest of the British majority, he had opposed the
Bill with a restrained but overwhelming plea for
the common rights of freedom, as English people
understand them. In one significant passage, after
referring to “the malignant activity of certain unscrupulous
correspondents” who had recently been
trying to lash the British public into a panic by
false versions of events and private utterances, he
added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The saddest part of the whole thing is that the Secretary
of State for India has fallen a victim to these grievous misrepresentations.
Possessing no personal knowledge of the
people of this country, and overwhelmed with a sense
of the vast responsibilities of his office, he has allowed his
vision to be obscured, and his sense of proportion to be
warped. From time to time he has let fall ominous hints
in the House of Commons, and more than once he has
spoken as though some great trouble were brewing in India
and the country were on the eve of a dark disaster. My
Lord, in these circumstances the passing of a Bill like the
present, and in such hot haste, is bound to have the effect of
confirming the false impression which has been already
created in England, and this cannot fail to intensify and
deepen still further the sense of injustice and injury, and
the silent resentment with which my countrymen have
been watching the course of events during the last few
months.”</p>
</div>

<p>Here, on the edge of the rocky country west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of Poona, close beside the Fergusson College for
Indians, with which he had been so long connected,
he had laid the foundation of his “Servants
of India Society” two years before, and in the two-roomed
cells about a dozen Knights of the Order
were already living. They were men prepared, in
the language of the Society’s rules, “to devote their
lives to the cause of the country in a religious spirit,
and to promote, by all constitutional means, the
national interests of the Indian people.” The object
of the Society is to train the Servants as national
missionaries, ready to visit any part of India at the
order of the First Member and Council, in the
hope of creating a deep and passionate love of
the country, organizing political teaching, promoting
goodwill among the different races, assisting education,
especially of women, and raising the people
who live below even the lowest caste.</p>

<p>Each Servant of India remains under close training
for five years, but out of the five years he
spends two in visiting various parts of India, so as
to know the people’s needs at first hand. Even
when his novitiate is complete, he is required to
live two months every year in the Headquarters,
and, like the Monastic Orders, all the members
take vows—to give their best to the service of the
country; to earn no money for themselves and seek
no personal advantage; to regard all Indians as
brothers, without distinction of caste or creed; to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
engage in no personal quarrel; and to lead a pure
personal life. In this Order, as in other similar
societies throughout India, there is a growing tendency
to celibate consecration, like the Roman
priesthood’s. But the last vow does not exclude
marriage. In fact, there is a provision that every
member under training shall have his personal
expenses borne by the Society, but be granted £2
a month for his family, if he has one, and that
after his novitiate the full member shall bear the
expenses of himself and family out of a grant of
£3 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> (Rs. 50) a month, with an extra allowance
for the insurance of each child as it comes.</p>

<p>The merely learned side of the Order is represented
by a large library, already containing rows
on rows of the many great books that Indians and
Englishmen have written on India, together with a
selection from the history of liberty in all countries.
That is the library’s distinction. Beginning with
England herself, and passing right down the glorious
roll to the Russia of 1905, it has here collected the
long record of man’s gradual and hard-won conquest
of freedom.</p>

<p>Social reform is certainly one side of the Society’s
work. To free the laborious peoples of India from
the bondage they lay on themselves in harassing
ritual, immature marriages, exclusion from life’s
decencies of some fifty millions, who eat dead
animals and think they commit mortal sin if their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
shadow touches a Brahman—to free the common
people gradually from these obsolete ways, and to
spread among them the first inkling of knowledge,
for which the Government does not yet afford the
money—these are objects common to most Indian
reformers, and natural under the tradition of Ranade.
Such purposes are missionary in the ordinary sense,
like the efforts of our missionary societies or university
settlements. Only those who are dubious
about all missionary efforts could criticize them.
I am dubious myself, only because no one has ever
deliberately missionized me without driving me
further into sin, if only as a relief from his presence.
For I keep in my mind that saying of Thoreau’s:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my
house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should
run for my life as from that dry and parching wind of the
African deserts, called the simoom, which fills the mouth
and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated,
for fear I should get some of his good done to me—some
of its virus mingled with my blood.”</p>
</div>

<p>But I think the cause of all this peril and terror
really lies, not in the good that might be done to
myself, but in a certain disintegration in the missionary
nature, an over-maturity or staleness of
virtue that rots the good before I get it. If it
were possible for the missionary spirit to move
on the same insecure plane of pitfalls with me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
unconscious of any salutary purpose beyond its
own difficult salvation, one might possibly escape
its virus without running in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>That is why the frankly political side of the
Society is so welcome. Politics, being less intimate
to the soul, appear less dangerous for a teacher than
social reform or philanthropy, in which some kind
of moral or class superiority is nearly always assumed.
Regarding the Society’s attitude towards the British
Government, I had better quote from its own
little book of rules:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Its members frankly accept the British connection, as
ordained, in the inscrutable dispensation of Providence, for
India’s good. Self-government on the lines of the English
colonies is their goal. This goal, they recognize, cannot be
attained without years of earnest and patient work and
sacrifice worthy of the cause.”</p>
</div>

<p>Many have smiled over that “inscrutable dispensation
of Providence.” Naturally, I took it for
irony myself, though I felt that irony was out of
tune with the Society’s regulations. But it is not
irony. Mr. Gokhale’s nature is too direct, his
purpose too simple in its intensity, for the ironic
bypaths.</p>

<p>I was dining that night with such of the Servants
of India as had not gone home for the family festival.
Mr. Paranjbye was there too—Senior Wrangler of
his year, Fellow of St. John’s, present Head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Fergusson College close by, famous among European
mathematicians, and almost tolerated in the Anglo-Indian
society of Poona for his skill at lawn tennis.
Mr. Kelkar had come as well—editor of the
<cite>Mahratta</cite>, a leader in the Extremist camp, Mr.
Tilak’s vigilant captain. And a few more Brahmans
and others sat with us, not too sacrificial in purity to
eat beside a carnivorous European. That “inscrutable
dispensation” was discussed amid laughter,
but Mr. Gokhale retained his accustomed serenity.
He had written the words with entire seriousness.
The dispensations of Providence were inscrutable,
but still he believed the British connection was ordained
for India’s good. It had secured various
things which any one could count, but above all it
had instilled into the Indian nature a love of
freedom and a self-assertion against authority that
Indians used to lack, but English people often possess
in enviable abundance.</p>

<p>I remember quoting the common opinion that
Anglo-Indians have lost sympathy with Indians
because they no longer make India their home, but
keep one eye on England and are always on the flit.
But Mr. Gokhale disagreed. He thought it an
advantage that fewer English people now settled in
the country. The fairly permanent residents, like
shopkeepers and planters, were as a rule the worst
mannered and most domineering, and they took hardly
any part in public life. The standard of manners in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
general, he thought, had gone down. It might be
that, in old days, the Englishman found it easier to
be sympathetic with natives whom he could treat as
dear good things. But educated Indians had come
to detest such sympathy as only fit for pet animals,
and both races were beginning to notice the change.
For his part, he thought that since Lord Ripon left
India in 1884, the type of Englishman that came out
had slowly been declining.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is unfortunate,” he said, “that our Congress movement
should have coincided with the past twenty-two
years of violent reaction and Imperialism in England. You
can hardly imagine how intolerable our life became at the
time of the Boer war. The insolence of Anglo-Indian
papers, like the <cite>Englishman</cite> or the <cite>Civil and Military
Gazette</cite> towards our people goes beyond all bounds. Yet
the <cite>Civil and Military Gazette</cite>, which is the worst
offender, has only received a mild remonstrance from the
Lieut.-Governor of the Punjab, while the editors of Indian
papers are in gaol.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Such treatment, however, is the inevitable
penalty of a conquered race, and, I think, within
the last year manners have mended a little. Lord Minto,
at all events, is very much the gentleman himself.</p>

<p>“During the last three years of Lord Curzon’s time,”
he continued, “we were kept in a state of perpetual
irritation. Then came our high hopes from the Liberal
Party, and our violent disappointment. The worst of all
is that many people are beginning to lose faith in English
integrity and sense of justice—the two main qualities that
could be used for the maintenance of your power. It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
new thing, but our young men are beginning to ask what is
the good of constitutional agitation if it only results in insult
and the Partition of Bengal? That is how Extremists are
created. There are two schools of them now, one here in
Poona, the other in Bengal itself, and Anglo-Indians are
always calling upon us to denounce them. But we are not
likely to denounce a section of our own people in face of
the bureaucracy. For, after all, they have in view the same
great object as ourselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>For himself, I discovered many months afterwards
that Mr. Gokhale hated the name of Moderate,
as, I suppose, all beings of flesh and blood needs
must. But, for brief, one has to call by some such
name the party which continues in patience and hope
to believe that appeals to justice and reason may still
induce the English people to grant reform.</p>

<p>For the Simla scheme, recently put out by Mr.
Morley for criticism,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> no Indian whom I met had
anything to say, except Mr. Gokhale alone, who
thought he detected one or two minor points that
might possibly be of advantage. He condemned
the Imperial Advisory Council entirely, as sure to
produce a body of half-educated ruling chiefs and
territorial magnates, powerless to stand against any
Government proposal, and unlikely to be summoned
except to discuss a royal visit, a statue, a famine, or
the plague. But from the Provincial Advisory
Councils he thought something might possibly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
gained, if at least half the members were elected on
a high franchise and were bound to meet for the
discussion of definite local subjects so many times
a year.</p>

<p>The attempt to clutch at any possible chance
of good was characteristic of the man. With all his
power he repels the temptation to sulky aloofness,
always a strong temptation to enthusiasts in opposition.
It is true he could find nothing to say for the
Simla proposal of enlarging the Viceroy’s Legislative
Council from twenty-four to fifty-three, by packing
it with representatives of Chambers of Commerce,
Mohammedans, and landowners. Such a scheme was
too obviously only an attempt to crush down the
influence of the education which has been one of
England’s greatest gifts to India. It was a reversal
of all British policy, which had hitherto set itself to
depress the landlord gentry and men of wealth who
“have a stake in the country,” and to stand as
protector of the poor. The whole thing was too
evidently framed in the spirit of fear and not of
progress. But nevertheless, in Mr. Gokhale’s own
scheme of reforms, an enlargement of the Legislative
Councils is a prominent clause. That and some
genuine control over the Budget by representative
Indians on the Viceroy’s Council would start the
reform of political machinery. In other departments
the old cry for complete separation of judicial and
executive functions must be listened to, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
even the lower officials in districts should never act
both as prosecutor and judge. In the same public
services, Indians should be granted an improved
position in accordance with Queen Victoria’s Proclamation,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and, above all, the teaching of children
should be gradually extended till it became free and
compulsory, even in villages. There were a few
other points in Mr. Gokhale’s programme of immediate
reform. But in none could I discover a trace
of that vagueness and impracticable demand, that
“crying for the moon,” of which Mr. Morley
and other critics of Indian demands were then
complaining.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I met Mr. Gokhale many times again—in
Poona itself, Surat, Bombay, and London—and his
reasonable and open-hearted personality will often
re-appear in this record. But to myself I still picture
him on that Diwali evening in the refectory where
the Servants of India were gathered round him,
together with friends from both the main Parties of
the time. In concession to my outlandish habits, I
was allowed a table, chair, and spoon at dinner. But
the sons of the country sat on boards level with the
floor, their backs against the walls, and in front of
each of us was laid half a plantain or banana leaf,
neatly studded round the edge with little piles of
rice, beans and other seeds, flavours, sauces and
other condiments, together with thin wheaten cakes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Which when we had eaten, and drunk clean water
from round brazen vessels such as all Indians carry
when they walk, we washed up by burning the
plantain leaves, rinsed our hands, and continued the
discussion over pomegranate seeds, orange cloves,
and pan-leaves concealing beetel-nut and various
spice. Serene, modest, definite in aim and in knowledge,
he continued to discourse with us, until the
full moon rolled westward, and under her obscure
silence I returned to the city of the plague, where
the oil lamps were now extinguished, and the children
asleep.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The bubonic plague, as I said, had been known in
India for only eleven years, but from the first the
common people had noticed its connection with rats.
The sight of a dead rat in a house spread terror, and
when rats crept out upon the floors, regardless of
man, and lay panting to death, it was early recognized
that the plague was at hand. The unlearned
observed these warnings, but no one detected their
full significance, and for many years the pestilence
was attributed to bad water or overcrowded and
insanitary houses.</p>

<p>In Poona it was thought there was too much
water about, and the officer of health undertook
the remedial measure of draining a rather nice
pond that used to be behind the Deccan Club, and
converting it into as malarial a marsh as I have
ever seen outside West Africa. The authorities,
in their perplexity, also set about cleansing the
quarters and homes of the Indian population, who,
I suppose, are, on the whole, the most scrupulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
about washing and cleaning of any working people
in the world. They tried disinfectants, and poured
thousands of pounds in the form of chemicals down
drains, ditches, and streets. Sometimes, by mistake,
they poured things that do not disinfect, and still
the plague went on. They tried “segregation.”
They divided the city into compartments under
military guard, and sent British soldiers into the
homes to examine men, women, and children, and
take them off to isolated hospitals if there was a sign
of plague. The symptom from which the plague
takes its name of “bubonic” is the swelling of the
great glands in the groin into hard lumps. No
greater profanation of the Indian reverence for home
and women could be imagined than this forcible
entrance and examination by men—by soldiers of
another race. No matter how kindly and decent
and respectful our men were, no virtue on their
part could prevent their presence and action from
infuriating any population, especially in an Asiatic
town. Riots broke out, and when I was in Poona,
a small stone was put up to mark the spot on
the country road to Government House, where
the Chairman of the Plague Committee had been
murdered, together with a young officer who happened
to be with him. When the youth who
conceived the deed was sentenced, he said to the
judge, “You may hang me to-morrow, but my
soul will at once pass into another body, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
sixteen years it will be fighting against the English
again.”</p>

<p>The kindly zeal, the strenuous measures, the
fatherly concern, the haste to do something, the
utter inability to understand another point of view,
are alike characteristic of our Government and of
the elephant that sat on the orphaned eggs to hatch
them.</p>

<p>From that time, I believe, arose a peculiar
bitterness and feeling of distrust towards our rule
that slowly permeated the country, and are still
particularly strong in Poona itself. But their origin
is distant now, and when I was there all our old
methods had long been abandoned. There was now
no examination for suspected cases, and no military
searching of houses. The people were not “segregated,”
and general disinfection was given up.
Inoculation and “health camps” had become the
Government methods now. The object of inoculation
was the same as similar processes in other
diseases, like small-pox or typhoid; the object of
the “health camps” was simply to separate human
beings from rats.</p>

<p>That old connection between rats and plague
had lately been examined afresh, chiefly by Dr.
Turner, the Public Health Officer in Bombay, and
the theory of the rat-flea had sprung into science.
Contemplate a dead rat lying on your floor in the
day-time, and you will find numerous fleas leaping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>up and down upon his body. If you are wise and
prudent, you will rapidly pour kerosene over him
from a distance, and then set him alight. For if,
having seen him brewing in the air, you do not
thus nip him in the bud, you are likely to fall a
victim to the plague after sunset. A rat’s fleas are
not the harmless, homely insects that we know.
This species of flea has a special predilection for
rats, and they will not leave their favourite home if
they can help it, at all events by day. At night,
when the rat is dead, they have to go, and then,
as a last resort, they will take refuge on a human
body for want of better sustenance. But with
them they bring the germ that has killed the rat.</p>

<p>Whether they themselves infect the rat in the
first instance, or whether they only transmit from
him a bacillus which the rat has developed from
other origins, I have not discovered; but I suppose
the latter. Nor am I quite sure whether the fleas
die of plague themselves or remain immune. Anyhow,
the theory is that when once they have passed
the germ into a human being’s blood, the plague
is assured. In a climate like India’s the most careful
and cleanly people can never be secure against fleas,
for, wash as they will, some insect or other is pretty
certain to be biting them every minute of the day
and night, and it is difficult to distinguish one bite
from another. A further terror is that the little
grey squirrel with paler stripes, which draws no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
distinction of race or riches, and swarms throughout
India, even on the roofs of the wealthiest bungalows,
is quite as much a favourite with the fleas as any rat
could be. While I was in Poona they were climbing
over my verandah and scampering across my floor
by dozens, and I took a peculiarly personal interest
in their health, which happily appeared excellent.</p>

<p>The British Government was, at the time, buying
rats alive at some fraction of a farthing a head.
They had already purchased 25,000 in the town
when I was there, and everywhere one met industrious
Hindus carrying rats in cages to the
official rat-collector. Whether the price was high
enough to induce industrious Hindus to breed rats
for the British market, I do not know. But I
believe it was found that the reduction of the rat
population gave the survivors such increased vitality
that never had such active and powerful specimens
of rat been seen before.</p>

<p>There is no very strict rule about the season for
plague. Sometimes it comes in the rains, sometimes
in the drought. Usually it is worst at the end of
winter, but in 1907, when nearly 70,000 people died
in a week in the Punjab, it was approaching the
height of summer. As a rule the season lasts three
months, and in bad seasons at Poona the cases go up
to 100 a day. While I was there, the rate, as I said
above, was comparatively low—only 12, 15, or 20
cases a day. But in the Presidency of Bombay, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
whole, people were dying by 7000 a week, and
that seems a good deal, even though the population
of the provinces is 18,000,000, including Scinde.
The British Isles count for more than twice that
number, but if we began dying of plague by 7000
a week, I dare say there would arise such a commotion
for escape as when you stir up an ants’ nest
with a stick.</p>

<p>In Poona the Government had erected rows of
tin huts as a hospital on some vacant ground just
beyond the railway station, and there I was able
to observe cases of the pestilence in every stage.
There were from 80 to 100 men, women, and
children admitted as patients, and the men and
women were laid in separate rows. But otherwise
not much difference could be made between the
patients as to caste and habits, though some of the
Brahmans had their food sent in from outside
when they were recovering, like first-class misdemeanants
in our prisons. It is rather peculiar
that the Brahmans offer least resistance to the
disease, and this the Sister-in-charge attributed to
the strictness of their vegetarianism for ages past.
To Europeans it is less fatal than to any Indians,
but, next to Europeans, the lowest or “sweeper”
caste, who will eat anything anyhow, almost like
Europeans themselves, are the best patients, and
show the most recoveries. There may, however,
be other reasons for this difference besides the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
food—I mean the natural hardiness of the labouring
class, and the natural tendency of all highly organized
and sensitive beings to collapse under fever.</p>

<p>Each patient in hospital lay in a separate
cubicle, and mothers or other relations were allowed
to visit and sit there. A plague-stricken mother
might, I believe, even bring a young child with her,
so great was the confidence in the new theory of
infection and in the absence of rats. The stories
of instant and unavoidable contagion in other
plagues, such as the plague of London, seem to
separate those diseases in kind from this bubonic
plague; but very likely the stories were not true,
or what was considered to be contagion was in
reality an underlying common origin.</p>

<p>It was some comfort to a mother to be allowed
to watch her thin, bright-eyed child panting its life
away, but the absorbed intensity of her watching,
as a rule, had not to continue long. The disease
begins with violent headache and a rapidly increasing
temperature; the breath becomes terrible, and
the tongue chalky white or bluish. There is a
strong objection to taking food or drink, and milk
is often spat out by a spasm in the throat, as in
hydrophobia. Delirium supervenes about the third
day and usually lasts to the sixth, when most
patients die. During the delirium there is an
extreme desire to get up and walk about, so that
many patients have to be strapped down to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
beds. Far the most important thing is to keep the
patient absolutely still, as death most frequently
comes from collapse of the heart, and recovery
depends almost entirely upon the patient’s constitutional
power of heart action. An English lady,
who had come through the disease, told me that
even during the delirium she seemed to be dimly
conscious of the strain on the heart; but this
memory may have been only suggestion. I think
the delirious patients that I saw would be incapable
of remembering anything of those three days, even
if they recovered.</p>

<p>Meantime, in their benign efforts to work off
the poison in the blood, the glands have from a
very early stage developed into hard lumps that
usually suppurate and have to be incised, but sometimes
absorb without operation. When I touched
the glands in the groin, they felt like walnuts under
the skin, and it is, as I said, the presence of this
obvious symptom which gives the plague its characteristic
name of “bubonic,” from the Greek
word for groin. After incision, the patient’s temperature
often goes down rapidly, but, in any case,
the pain from the glands is usually very great;
indeed, I think it is the chief cause of such pain
as the plague gives.</p>

<p>Next to heart failure, the commonest cause of
death is lung complication after the crisis of fever
is passed. The prostration when the temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
begins to decline is usually extreme, and some
patients whom I saw were so emaciated that they
appeared to be parodies of famine—legs and arms
like sticks, back and ribs like frameworks of bone.
It is true that probably they were not very fat when
they went into hospital. The delirium often leaves
the patients silly, and if I had been in Central
Africa again, I should have said at once that several
of them had sleeping sickness in the third or fourth
month—the time when, in sleeping sickness, the
control over the emotions begins to fail. The
nurses in the hospital were Indian women, under
the direction of a European Sister.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>While I was still in Poona, Sir George Clarke,
the new Governor of Bombay, who was already
winning the confidence and respect of Indians in all
parties by his straightforward ways and his freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
from official routine, issued a proclamation giving
the actual statistics of the plague, and calling on the
people to submit themselves voluntarily to inoculation
as the only means of defence yet discovered. The
proclamation was read about the streets in Mahrati,
the people listening patiently, and then reflecting.
Many Indians have a feeling against inoculation,
just as thousands of English people have. They
regard it as some sort of contamination, even when
it is voluntary, and the memory of an old error in
the serum that poisoned a village dies hard.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There
is also a certain amount of national and even religious
prejudice on the subject. The thing is European;
it does not fit in with Hindu tradition, and Mr.
Tilak, the most powerful political and religious force
in Poona, was known at that time to oppose it.
Still, it had been proved that, as a rule, no great
harm was done, and, on the off-chance that it might
save their lives, many took it. For inoculation
there was the further inducement of sixpence bestowed
on each patient by a considerate Government,
so as to tide over the two or three days’
gentle illness that usually follows the operation.</p>

<br>

<p>It naturally occurs to one that many a poor but
dishonest man would gladly be inoculated every day
of his life for sixpence, or would, at all events,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>induce his wife and children thus to contribute to
the family budget. Very likely that happens from
time to time in the case of far-seeing people who are
resolved to avail themselves fully of the Government’s
prophylactic measures. But some real check
upon this form of prudence is imposed by the appearance
of the arm, and an official check is also kept
by an elaborate system of finger-print records—one of
the most official farces I have ever seen. Even more
embarrassing, however, than the thrifty man is he
who, feeling rather unwell, hastens up to be inoculated,
and is found to be developing the plague
already. Of course, nothing will persuade him that
his visit to the inoculator was not the cause of the
disease, and much suspicion is spread in this way
among the people. It is, in any case, extremely
difficult to induce women to take the inoculation.
Everything possible is done to shelter their feelings;
a most discreet curtain is hung to protect them
from sight and make them feel at home; one of
their own people is the operator, and only an inch or
two of arm is exposed, whereas they never have the
slightest objection to walking in the crowd with legs
and waist quite bare at any hour of the day. Yet
the whole traditional instinct of Indian womanhood,
from the day of Sita, Rama’s wife, rises up in
protest against such a profanation.</p>

<p>At four separate points of the native city the
Government had set up stations where all comers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
might be inoculated free—not only free, but with
that sixpenny reward. In the midst of the central
market-place, where elderly bangle-merchants, with
the help of soapy powder, were squeezing gorgeous
glass bangles from China over women’s hands, and
men and women were squatted on the stones, chaffering
over little heaps of queer vegetables and fruit, I
found a native apostle of science and fatherly Government
preaching the terrors of plague and the glory of
redemption by serum. Before him was fixed a little
spirit stove, on which boiling vaseline simmered.
At his side was a glass saucer containing scraps of
cotton wool dipped in strong carbolic. One hand
gesticulated the truths of nature, the other held a
little glass syringe, with a long, sharp beak, and
any one could see that the syringe was half full
of yellow salvation. Under the mingled influences
of rhetoric and fear of death, a man stepped forward
from the listening half-circle. With the carbolic
wool the expositor washed the dust from the thin
brown arm, told the patient to admire an imaginary
bird in the opposite direction, just like a Margate
photographer with a child, and plunged the sharp-nosed
syringe first into the boiling vaseline and then
under the brown skin. Instantly it was withdrawn,
but a drop or two of the yellow salvation had gone,
and for three or four months—say, for the length of
one plague season, but only for that—the man was
fairly safe. The crowd sighed its satisfaction, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
when a rocket bursts. The place on the arm was
wiped with carbolic wool. “Take his thumb mark,
give him the paper of instructions, pay him his six
annas,” said the apostle of bacillary science in
Mahrati to a subordinate, and the labour of a
fatherly Government struggling with adversity went
doggedly on.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> For the sake of comparison it may be of interest to quote a few of
the symptoms given in descriptions of other plagues. The account by
Thucydides (ii. 49) of the plague in Athens, 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, is the most
detailed: “All of a sudden,” he says, “people who were quite well
before were seized with violent pains in the head, together with redness
and inflammation of the eyes; the throat and tongue became blood-red,
and the breath strangely disagreeable. Sneezing and sore throat ensued,
and after a short time the lungs were affected and there was violent
coughing. When the disease settled in the stomach it caused great
disorder, with every known kind of purging of bile, accompanied by
severe pain. Most patients suffered from an empty retching, with
violent spasms, that sometimes gave relief at once, sometimes only after
a long time. The surface of the body was not very hot to touch, nor
was it pale, but suffused red or livid, covered with small spots and ulcers.
But the internal heat was so great that the patients could not endure
even the lightest clothes or muslins, but insisted on being naked, and
longed to throw themselves into cold water. Many who were not
looked after actually jumped into wells, overcome with unquenchable
thirst; but it was just the same whether a patient drank much or little.
All through the illness they were unable to keep still or get any sleep.
Whilst the fever was at its height the body did not waste away, but
resisted the disease beyond all expectation, so that most patients died
from the internal fever on the seventh or ninth day with a good deal
of strength still left; or, if they survived the crisis, the disease descended
to the bowels, where it set up ulceration and such violent diarrhœa
that in most cases death ensued from weakness.”</p>

<p>The chief symptoms given by Boccaccio in the Introduction
to the “Decameron,” where he describes the plague in Florence (1348),
are: “At the beginning of the disease both men and women developed
swellings in the groin or under the armpit. These swellings grew to
the size of a crab-apple or an egg, sometimes larger, sometimes less, and
the common people called them ‘gavoccioli.’ In a short time this
deadly sore began to spread to all parts of the body, and the nature of
the disease gradually changed into black or livid spots, which appeared
on the arms and thighs and other parts, sometimes large and scattered,
sometimes minute and thick together.” He goes on to speak of the
entire inability of doctors to deal with the plague, and of the readiness
with which the smallest association or contagion spread it from one to
another.</p>

<p>Defoe wrote only at secondhand about the plague of London (1665),
but such symptoms as he gives of that “spotted fever” were probably
taken from eye-witnesses with whom he had conversed. He mentions
violent pains in the head, vomitings, and spots on the thighs; also
“swellings, generally in the neck and groin, which, when they grew
hard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal to the
most exquisite torture.... In some these swellings were made hard,
partly by the force of the distemper, and partly by their being too
violently drawn, and were so hard that no instrument could cut them,
and then they burnt them with caustics, so that many died raving mad
in the torment, and some in the very operation. In these distresses,
some for want of help to hold them down in their beds, or to look to
them, laid hands upon themselves. Some broke out into the streets,
perhaps naked, and would run directly down to the river, if they were
not stopped by the watchman or other officer, and plunge themselves
into the water, wherever they found it.”</p>

inoculation for the time.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">The Extremist</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I knew it would come. Till I had been some time
in Bombay, I did not realize the custom, but the
moment I realized it, I felt there was no escape.
As often happens with forebodings, it came unexpectedly
in the end. I was visiting the simple
house, workshop, and garden, in a main street of
Poona, where the two Extremist papers are published.
Both appear weekly—the <cite>Mahratta</cite> in
English, the <cite>Kesari</cite> or <cite>Lion</cite> in the Mahrati
language. Both are owned and directed by Mr.
Tilak, the acknowledged leader of the Extremists
in India, but the <cite>Mahratta</cite> was edited by Mr.
Kelkar, an intellectual, keen-tempered Brahman,
who accompanied me over the printing office and
showed me a courteous friendliness all through my
stay in Poona. Both papers have obtained what
is thought a large circulation in India—the <cite>Mahratta</cite>
selling 11,000 a week, the <cite>Kesari</cite> close upon twice
that number. In outward appearance, the <cite>Mahratta</cite>
is very much like the <cite>Spectator</cite>. The <cite>Kesari</cite>, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
lions in emblem defiant on each side of the tide,
is on cheaper paper of eight folded pages. Its
language is said to be more violent than the
<cite>Mahratta’s</cite>, which as a rule is carefully moderate
in expression.</p>

<p>In the cool and quiet of the editor’s room,
among bookshelves mildewing like most Indian
libraries, I was listening to the history of the
papers when I observed a crowd of brown printers,
deferential but eager, at the door. In their hands
they bore strange objects, such as I had never
before seen, but at a glance I knew the moment
had arrived. Advancing to my chair they hung
around my neck a thick festoon of orange marigolds,
picked out with the silvery tinsel which
decorators of our Christmas trees identify with
fairy rain. They encircled both my wrists with
orange bracelets to match, and in my right hand
they placed an arrangement of variegated flowers
and spangles, stiff and formal as the sceptre of the
Tsar. So I sat enthroned, and if only a correspondent
from Calcutta had been present, the
broadsheets of London that evening might have
screamed with scare-heads of “Sedition!” Even in
the midst of my friendly embarrassment, I could
not but regret a journalistic opportunity lost.</p>

<p>Embarrassing, certainly it was, but only to my
British ignorance and shyness. To complete the
Imperial ceremony, my dusky subjects sprinkled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
me with delicate odours from silvern vessels; they
soused my handkerchief in scent; they rubbed
spikenard and aloes on the back of my hands.
Then, standing at a distance, they contemplated
their handiwork with kindly satisfaction, while I
laboured to express my august gratification in an
Imperial tongue they could not understand. Every
one present knew, and I knew myself, that they
would have honoured in the same way any visitor
who had come to their works in a benignant spirit.
Even when, hung with fillets like a sacrificial victim
and bearing the floral sceptre upright in my hand,
I issued from the front door into the full blaze of
the public street, the passers-by looked at me with
admiring interest, but without a trace of laughter.
These things are merely habit, and before I left
India I lived to dread garlands as little as my bed.
But that first time—with what shamefaced horror
the consciousness of my British trousers and khaki
helmet filled me! Suddenly, with an inexplicable
pang, I remembered that I had once rowed two
in the Christ Church torpid, and if any of my own
countrymen had gone down the street at that
moment, I think I should have got under my cart
instead of into it.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<br>

<p>Thus ornamented by a graceful hospitality, I
drove away, some sixteen miles south-west of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>city, through an irrigated and fertile land of terraced
rice-fields, draining the abundant water that
rice flourishes in from one level into another.
Slowly we drew near a great blue mountain, conspicuous
from Poona among the other hills for its
height and flat-topped outline. It is the mountain
fortress of Singarh, famed in Deccan history. Unknown
peoples had made it their rock of defence,
Mohammedans had reigned there, Mahrattas took
it by storm. Finally the British, some ninety
years ago, bombarded the place till it could stand
no more, and now all that afternoon I had watched
a British helio on its summit blinking messages
to the Poona cantonment. There is a long, steep
climb before the old fortifications that run round
the edge of the cliffs are reached, for the top is
as high as Ben Nevis. But passing through a
western arch in the walls we entered on the broad
grassy plateau while still the low horizon was
brilliant with sunset, and against the sunset a red-turbaned,
white-clad figure, upright but using a long
staff, came to meet me.</p>

<p>Bal Gangadhar Tilak appeared to be about ten
years older than Mr. Gokhale, but it is difficult
to tell his age, for if ever he takes off his Mahratta
turban, one sees his head shaven to the back, where
the hair grows in a long, black tuft, as is the fashion
of his race or caste. His full, brown eyes are singularly
brilliant, steady with daring, rather aggressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
But his general manner is very quiet and controlled,
and both in conversation and public speaking he
talks in brief, assured sentences, quite free from
rhetoric, outwardly passionless even in moments
of the highest passion, and seldom going beyond
the statement of facts, or, rather, of his aspect of
facts at the time. His apparent calmness and
self-command may arise partly from courageous
indifference to his own future, partly from prolonged
legal practice at his own trials. At first one
would say, his was the legal mind, subtle, given
to fine distinctions, rather capable of expressing
thought than of thinking, and quick to adapt both
the expression and the thought to the audience
of the moment. But there is much in his life and
energies that seems to show that his natural bias was
towards religious speculation and scholarly traditions.</p>

<p>Among the leading reformers of India, he is
probably the most orthodox Hindu. He professes
a devout belief in progressive Hinduism and in
successive reincarnations of Krishna at epochs of
India’s greatest need. But in practice his Hinduism
often reacts against the forces of progress, and
serves him as an ally in resisting the materializing
notions imported from the West. In scholarship,
he is known among all Sanscrit scholars as one
of the closest and most original. His book on
“The Arctic Home of the Vedas” maintains from
internal evidence that the Sacred Books of India<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
originated among a glacial people inhabiting the
region of the Arctic Circle, or some land equally
chilly. I cannot say what the value of the theory
may be. Possibly the book is as fantastic as it is
learned. But to me it is significant because it
appeared in the midst of the author’s direst persecution,
when money, reputation, influence, and
everything were at stake, and few men would have
had the courage to spare a thought either for Sacred
Books or Arctic Circles.</p>

<p>It is said that he is embittered. One of the
highest and best of English officials in India told
me he admired Mr. Tilak, and would gladly know
him personally, but was afraid of inviting him for
fear of a rebuff, so irreconcilable was the man
reputed. Yet when the meeting did take place,
by a kind of accident some weeks later, there was
no rebuff, but only courtesy and openly expressed
esteem. Certainly, if a fine nature can ever be
embittered, Mr. Tilak has had enough to embitter
him. Early in the ’eighties he was imprisoned for
speaking against the Diwan or Prime Minister of
a Native State, whom he accused of cruelty to
the Raja. In September, 1897, he was sentenced
to eighteen months’ imprisonment for attacks in
the <em>Kesari</em> upon the Bombay Government when
the population of Poona was frenzied at the plague
regulations. After a year in gaol he was released,
but soon afterwards he became involved in a private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
suit concerned with his trusteeship for a widow
named Tai Maharaj and her adoption of an heir.
The Bombay Government took up the case, and
the trial, with appeals, dragged on for nearly two
years, Mr. Tilak being condemned by one magistrate
to a long imprisonment and heavy fine. “The
paths of scholarship,” was the <cite>Pioneer’s</cite> comment,
“lead but to the gaol,” and in Court Mr. Tilak
was publicly handcuffed. Finally, in March, 1904,
his appeal came before the High Court of Bombay,
represented by Chief Justice Sir Lawrence Jenkins
and Mr. Justice Batty; the conviction and sentence
were quashed and the fine was ordered to be
refunded.</p>

<p>This judgment confirmed the common Indian
opinion that British justice can best be looked
for in the High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta, and
Madras, because the judges appointed directly by
the Crown can maintain the law without being
unconsciously prejudiced by long service under the
Anglo-Indian routine. But, unfortunately, owing to
Mr. Tilak’s past record, and his connection with the
Extremist papers, the ruinous action taken against
him had the air of persecution, and laid the Bombay
Government open to a charge of vindictiveness. It
was during these proceedings that Mr. Tilak displayed
his fine unconcern by issuing his treatise
on the origin of the Vedas, and in the end, when
his innocence was finally established, he found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
a leader’s greatest advantage of having suffered for
his cause was indefinitely increased.</p>

<p>When I met him that evening on the mountain
top, another crisis of his fate was just being decided,
but nothing could surpass his outward calm. He
was living in one of the dilapidated bungalows
thinly scattered over the plateau. I was put to
lodge in another empty one, because, belonging,
as he does, to the same high caste as Mr. Gokhale,
and to the same subsection of it, he refuses, as a
strict Hindu, to emancipate himself from the caste
obligations and live or eat with mere Europeans.
All that night the wind roared over the mountains,
but with the first sun he came to lead me round
the elaborate ruins of the fortifications, and, as
though he had no interest in the world except as
tourist’s guide, he showed me where the British
guns had battered, and where, in the time of the
Mahratta hero, Shivaji, two hundred and forty
years ago, his own ancestors crept up the precipice
at night and scaled this very wall, aided by a great
lizard that was trained to carry a string up the
surface and hold tight with its claws till a man
could climb. So at this dizzy spot the party had
climbed; then killed.</p>

<p>It is easy to perceive the marvels of the past,
and belief in them is unimportant. But to realize
the strange significance of the man at my side, and
to understand the things he believed in at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
moment was a different matter. He continued to
discourse about the villages half hidden in the
deep valleys below, and narrate their sufferings,
hopes, and varying prosperity as if he had no
further thought on earth beyond their cattle and
their rice. But I knew that at Nagpur in the
Central Provinces, things had just been happening
which deeply involved himself and his party. The
annual meeting of the National Congress was to
have been held there at Christmas. The Reception
Committee had met to appoint a President, and the
Moderates of the majority chose Dr. Rash Behari
Ghose. Thereupon, the Extremists, insisting upon
their majority in the Central Provinces and in the
Executive Committee, chose Mr. Tilak. He in
turn proposed Mr. Lajpat Rai, as a compromise;
but, with his usual chivalry, Mr. Lajpat Rai refused
to stand rather than risk a division among the
reform party, or an open breach between the Congress
and the Government. To be sure, deeper
questions of principle or of method lay behind
these personal disputes, but on the personal question
of the President the Nagpur meeting had just
broken up in disorder. The Moderates had determined
not to hold the Congress at Nagpur at
all, but to accept the invitation of Surat, only a
few hours’ journey north of Bombay, which was
the headquarters of the strongest section among
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Compared to the wild adventures of his
Mahratta ancestry, or to the economic conditions
of the peasants far below us, one might
have supposed from his manner that Mr. Tilak
regarded these party differences as beneath all
notice. Perhaps he did so regard them, and, if
he did, he was partially right. But still, at
the moment, the party difference was the thing
attracting most attention in India, and it was
sure to grow in importance. Mr. Tilak’s own
thoughts might have been occupied with the situation
all day, but it was only in the afternoon that
he came quietly into my empty bungalow alone,
and began to discuss it in his concise and definite
way. When I published a careful abstract of this
conversation shortly afterwards, many Moderates
and Extremists alike supposed that he had dissembled
his true intentions, and told me only what
he wished to be known. As he did not ask for
secrecy, certainly I never supposed he was telling
me things he did not wish to be known, and I
think it very likely that he enjoyed giving himself
the pleasure of appearing as Moderate as possible.
But in the evening I read over to him the notes
I had taken of the conversation just as it was
afterwards published, and he approved of what I
wrote. In studying his speeches and writings of
recent years, I have also found the lines of his
policy laid down in almost the same words as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
used to me, and I am inclined to think that his
statements resembled his beliefs rather closely.</p>

<p>His first object was to show that, as to their
immediate purpose, Extremists and Moderates did
not differ in aim:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is not by our purpose, but by our methods only,”
he said, “that our party has earned the name of Extremist.
Certainly, there is a very small party which talks about
abolishing the British rule at once and completely. That
does not concern us; it is much too far in the future.
Unorganized, disarmed, and still disunited, we should not
have a chance of shaking the British suzerainty. We may
leave all that sort of thing to a distant time. Our object
is to obtain eventually a large share in the administration of
our own country. Our remote ideal is a confederacy of the
Indian provinces, possessing colonial self-government, with
all Imperial questions set apart for the central government in
England. Perhaps our Home Rule would take the form of
Provincial Councils of fifty or sixty members, nominated or
indirectly elected at first, but elected by popular vote as
education became more general.</p>

<p>“But that ideal also,” he went on, “is far ahead of us—perhaps
generations ahead. What we aim at doing now is
to bring pressure on the bureaucracy; to make it feel that
all is not well. Of late the attitude of our British officials
has greatly changed for the worse. They no longer speak
of educating us up to freedom, as the great Englishmen like
Elphinstone did in the past. They appear to agree with
the <cite>Times</cite> that our education in subjects like English history
must be checked, because it is dangerous for ‘natives’ to
learn anything about freedom. Your present statesmen
seem to take the old Roman Empire as their ideal, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
even in that they follow the modern school of Oxford
historians, who trace the fall of the Empire to the concession
of citizenship to the provinces.</p>

<p>“I know the worst that you can say about the Russian
bureaucracy; but even that bureaucracy does, according to
its lights, seek to maintain the honour and prosperity of
Russia, because Russia is its own country. Our bureaucracy
administers a country not its own for the sake of
a country far away, entirely different in character and
interests. Our bureaucracy is despotic, alien, and absentee.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Tilak then referred to the well-known complaints
brought against our Administration by nearly
all students of Indian economics—the “drain” of
some £30,000,000 to £35,000,000 a year to
England in the shape of various payments from an
impoverished country; the ruin of Indian trades
and manufactures, first by duties against her exports,
and now by customs dues within her own borders,
deliberately imposed for the advantage of British,
Austrian, and American firms; the reduction of
very nearly the whole population to a subsistence on
a starving agriculture; and the unexplained increase
of malaria, famine, and plague.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The immediate question for us,” he continued, “is
how we are to bring pressure on this bureaucracy, in which
we have no effective representation, but are debarred from
all except subordinate positions. It is only in our answer
to that question that we differ from the so-called Moderates.
They still hope to influence public opinion in England by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
sending deputations, supporting a newspaper, and pleading
the justice of our cause. Both parties, of course, have long
ago given up all hope of influencing Anglo-Indian opinion
out here. But even in England we find most people
ignorant and indifferent about India, and the influence of
retired Anglo-Indians at home is perpetually against us.
When Lord Cromer said the other day that India must be
no party question, he meant that Liberals should support
the bureaucracy as blindly as Tories. The history of the
last year has proved to us how unexceptionably they fulfil
that duty.</p>

<p>“Under these disappointments we Extremists have determined
on other methods. It is a matter of temperament,
and the younger men are with us. Our motto is ‘Self-reliance,
not Mendicancy.’</p>

<p>“Besides the ordinary Swadeshi movement, we work by
boycott and passive resistance. Our boycott is voluntary.
We do not advocate picketing or compulsory prevention
from the purchase of foreign goods. And in passive
resistance we shall simply refuse to notice such measures
as the Seditious Meetings Act. But we do not care
what happens to ourselves. We are devoted absolutely and
without reservation to the cause of the Indian peoples. To
imprison even 3000 or 4000 of us at the same time would
embarrass the bureaucracy. That is our object—to attract
the attention of England to our wrongs by diverting trade
and obstructing the Government. Without in the least
intending it, England has promoted the idea of Indian
unity—by railways, by education, and the use of a
common official language. The mere pressure of the
British domination upon us makes for unity. Our unity
will not be complete, perhaps, for generations yet, but it
is the goal to which our faces are now set, and we shall not
turn back.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>As I said, many have suspected that, in this
statement of his party’s aims and methods, Mr.
Tilak was playing down to an Englishman’s love of
moderation. To some extent that may have been
true, but only, I think, with regard to the distance
in time at which he placed India’s realization of
self-government. On January 4, 1907, Mr. Tilak
had addressed the students in College Square,
Calcutta, upon the “Tenets of the New Party,”
and I extract a few sentences dealing with this
subject:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“There were certain points,” he said, “on which both
parties were agreed. The object both parties had at heart
was the same; it was self-government. The present system
of administration was ruinous to the country both materially
and morally.... There were some, indeed, who still
believed that the continuance of the British rule was necessary
for some centuries in order to raise them to the level of
civilized nations. Those who held such views obviously
could not follow his arguments, and they must agree to differ
and part as friends. But most of them were agreed that the
present system must be mended or ended as soon as possible.
Their object being the same, it was with regard to their
methods that the difference arose.</p>

<p>“... The New Party’s conclusion was that it was impossible
to gain any concessions by petitions and prayers.
This was the first difference between the Moderate and Progressive
parties. He did not believe in the philanthropy of
British politics. There was no instance in history of one
foreign nation ruling another for the benefit of the other and
not for its own profit. The rule of one nation by another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
was in itself unnatural. He granted the efficiency of the
British Government and the excellence of its methods for its
own purpose, but these methods and that efficiency did not
work for the interests of the people of the country. A good
foreign government was less desirable than an inferior native
government.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the question of revolution and revolutionary
violence, the following passage occurred in Mr.
Tilak’s address during the Shivaji Festival in Poona,
June, 1907:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is true that what we seek may seem like a revolution;
it is a revolution in the sense that it means a complete
change in the theory of the government of India as now put
forward by the bureaucracy. It is true that this revolution
must be a bloodless revolution, but it would be a folly to
suppose that if there is to be no shedding of blood, there are
also to be no sufferings to be undergone by the people. These
sufferings must be great. You can win nothing unless you
are prepared to suffer. An appeal to the good-feeling of the
rulers is everywhere discovered to have but narrow limits.
Your revolution must be bloodless, but that does not mean
that you may not have to suffer or to go to gaol.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When I left the mountain’s summit, Mr. Tilak
accompanied me back to the limit of the dark and
ancient walls. I recognized in him the personal
attraction that Extremists always have—the freedom
from hesitation and half-measures, the delight in
conflict, the reckless disregard of self. When to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
attraction his own people could add his personal and
intimate acquaintance with all classes among them
down to the poorest villagers, and his steady maintenance
of all that they held most dear in religious
belief and customary observances, I could not
wonder at his influence among them. So he stood
surrounded by the ruins of empires built by his own
and other races, while, with the merriment and ironic
humour I knew so well, our soldiers of the helio
party folded up their instruments among the rocks
close by and prepared for night.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smcap fs80">The Ryot’s Burden</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Several times in Poona I met a Mr. Junshi (as I
will call him), who lived in one of the beautiful
houses the Mahrattas used to build while their
Peshwas still reigned. He was an oldish man, for
an Indian, but thin, bright-eyed and alert, and from
his mouth statistics flowed like water from a fountain
statue. One day I called on him, and was shown
into the open courtyard of old marble and teak,
round which the main building rose in three stories;
but beyond I could see another courtyard, more
beautiful and cooler still, where lived his wife, his
sons’ wives, his nieces, and other ladies of the
blood, and beyond that again there was a glimpse
of leaves and brilliant flowers.</p>

<p>“We require flowers,” he said, “for the worship
of our idols. We worship our idols here in the
house every morning and evening, hanging garlands
round their necks and placing bunches of flowers
before them. You, I believe, worship only once a
week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>I told him I had been brought up on family
prayers that never failed in regularity, even when
we were at the seaside, and this pleased him very
much.</p>

<p>“However,” he went on, “I think we have an
advantage in acknowledging so many gods in our
pantheon that each of us can choose which he likes
best. For each of our idols is a symbol of some
divine attribute, and helps the worshipper to fix his
thoughts upon the attribute he most desires to
worship.”</p>

<p>“But some of us also,” I said, “find it helpful
to contemplate images representing the attributes of
motherly love, chastity, compassion, or courage in
the face of evil; and we offer flowers to them.”</p>

<p>This pleased him too, but when we reached his
long room upstairs we turned from idols to the
main interest of his life. On bookshelves round
the walls, and heaped upon the floor and tables,
were hundreds of volumes and pamphlets crammed
with figures. It seemed as if the owner had collected
every book and essay ever written upon the
economics of India, and year by year had filtered
them into his mind. He had the instinct for
averages which I take to be the economist’s instinct.
He thought of women and children in terms of
addition; he saw men as columns walking. He
watched the rising and falling curves of revenue,
expenditure, and population as others watch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
curves of beauty. Any line of figures was welcome
to his spirit, and though he had made his living by
teaching little Indians to read “Robinson Crusoe,”
his chief study seemed to lie in the scripture called
the “Statistical Abstract relating to British India.”
Upon this careful piece of literature he meditated
day and night; or, if his mind required a change,
he relaxed it on theology.</p>

<p>I have called the “Statistical Abstract” literature,
and to him it was so. To him it was as pleasing
as a poem to know that under the heading of
“Priests and others engaged in religion,” the
number of “total supported” was 2,728,812, among
whom 178,656 females were classified as “actual
workers”; or that the total supported by “indefinite
and disreputable occupations” was 737,033, and in
this class alone the male and female “actual workers”
were approximately equal. He liked to meditate
on the daily average of prisoners in the various
provinces, and on the infirmities of population
according to residence and according to age. It
was good to know that there were about 6,000,000
more males than females in the country, but
18,000,000 more widows than widowers, and 391,000
widows under fifteen. These were the lyrics or
realistic ballads of his reading, but he took higher
interest in the figures that move with something
of epic grandeur. To him there was a splendour
and æsthetic satisfaction in knowing that the total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
of India’s population, including the Native States,
was 294,361,056 in 1901, and that of this number
207,050,557 were Hindus like himself; while agriculture
supported 191,691,731—close upon two-thirds,
or 65·16 per cent., as he put it—and
15,686,421 (including nearly 1,000,000 females)
could write and read, a total of 1,125,231 being
“literate in English.”</p>

<p>But I think, after all, it was the great passage
headed “Finance” that he enjoyed with the most
delicate appreciation for style. Perhaps it depended
on his mood whether he more admired the lines
of the “Gross Revenue and Expenditure” or of
the “Net Revenue and Expenditure.” It was
sonorous as a hexameter to read aloud that the
total gross revenue in India and England for
1905-6 was £84,997,685, and the total gross
expenditure charged to revenue was £82,905,831.
But the net statements of revenue at £48,539,680,
and expenditure at £46,447,826, were trim as a
sonnet. It was a dubious point, but for details he
certainly preferred the gross, thinking them more
realistic, and his favourite passage was that beginning,
“Principal heads of Revenue, Land Revenue,
£18,862,169, for 1905-6.” Against this he would
set, as a kind of antiphone, the gross expenditure
on army services (excluding Marine and Military
Works) of £19,267,130.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>There were two passages also from which he
appeared to derive the kind of savage pleasure most
men seek in tragedy or satire. One was that the
gross expenditure on education by the Government
of India amounted to less than £1,700,000 in
1905-6, and he worked out the State expenditure
for education for the current year (1907-8) at
1½<em>d.</em> per head in India, as against 5<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> per head
in France. The other was that the Hindus,
Mohammedans, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Animists
contributed out of their labour during the
year of grace which we had just survived (1906-7)
the sum of £125,906 in order that the British
residents might not be devoid of the consolations
of religion as represented by Bishops and Anglican
chaplains, Roman priests, Presbyterian divines, and
cemeteries.</p>

<p>For myself, there was, of course, a certain ironic
interest in the endowment of an Anglo-Indian’s
Christianity by the natives around him, and for the
first time I was inclined to favour a system of
payment by results. But, in regard to Finance, all
such things are insignificant in comparison with the
one main question of the tax upon the cultivator.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>An immemorial custom in India, consolidated
in the Laws of Manu, gave the ruler a share in
all crops—a fraction fluctuating according to the
soil, but not higher than one quarter. Probably
this was a tribute levied upon the village community
in return for protection, or simply as a penalty
for conquest. It was paid in kind, so much grain
from so much crop, and as the proportion was
always the same on the same ground, the peasant
did not feel the variation in quantity much. But
having inherited the custom, the British rulers
found it more convenient and uniform to collect
the tax in cash, and to levy the rate, not in proportion
to each year’s crop, but on a valuation that
remains unaltered for long terms of years—usually
thirty years in Madras and Bombay, but twenty
years in other places, for instance in the Punjab.
This process of valuation is called the Settlement,
and Settlement Officers are almost continually engaged
in drawing up a kind of progressive Doomsday
Book upon the fields, pastures, woods, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
wells of each village. It is hardly possible to
ascertain the exact proportion of value fixed by
the Settlement Officers as the tax. Throughout
India there is a general understanding that “about
one-half of the well-ascertained net assets should
be the Government demand.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This income tax
of ten shillings in the pound is, however, in reality
a fairly steady minimum, and the tax often goes
higher, to say nothing of the “cesses” or local
taxes nominally levied for roads and education.</p>

<p>Whether the money is called tax or rent, would
not seem at first sight to make much difference;
for it has to be paid and the people who pay
it have no voice in its levy or in its expenditure.
If it is a tax, it is a large income tax on land,
fixed for some years and collected from the smallest
landowners as well as the largest. If it is a rent,
the system is partial land-nationalization without
national control and without economic freedom.
But as a matter of practice, the difference in the use
of words is vital, and it cannot be put more plainly
than in the Minute written by Lord Salisbury when
he was Secretary of State for India in 1875:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“If we say that it is rent, the modern Indian statesman
will hold the Government in strictness entitled to all
that remains after wages and profits have been paid, and he
will do what he can to hasten the advent of the day when
the State shall no longer be kept by any weak compromises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
from the enjoyment of its undoubted rights. If we persuade
him that it is revenue, he will note the vast disproportion of
its incidence compared to that of other taxes, and his efforts
will tend to remedy the inequality, and to lay upon other
classes and interests a more equitable share of the fiscal
burden. I prefer the latter tendency to the former.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The average Indian official does not agree with
Lord Salisbury. He prefers the rent theory to the
tax theory, and when the cultivator has been allowed
his subsistence off the holding, together with what
the official estimates as profit, the rent is taken in
the name of revenue, but under the excuse of rent,
and I have often heard officials urge the theory of
land nationalization in their defence. It is, however,
as I said, a nationalization in which the conditions of
political and economic freedom are absent.</p>

<p>The new assessment, which in Bombay lasts for
thirty years, depends almost entirely on the discretion
of the Settlement Officer. His decision
is supervised by higher authorities, but it usually
stands, and the only fixed rule for his guidance is
that he may not increase the revenue of a Taluka
(group of villages) by more than 33 per cent., nor
that of a single village by more than 66 per cent.,
nor that of a single holding by more than 100
per cent. This leaves him plenty of margin, and
in fifteen large districts of the Bombay Presidency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
we find that the average increase was 30·4 per cent.
at the last assessment (1899).<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This increase is
assessed, not on the yield of the ground, but on
the “capabilities” of the ground, and “capabilities”
are calculated upon the quality of the soil, the
average rainfall, the market, the railway, and
other elements of “unearned increment.” Mr.
Vaughan Nash’s account of the matter expresses
what happens:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The officer appointed to value the land and fix the
assessment has made his shot—I use the expression advisedly—at
the average crop, and has determined the demand which
is to hold for the next twenty or thirty years; and in theory
it is understood that the cultivator is to enjoy not less than
half the profits of his farm, beside the privilege of subsisting
on its produce.... At the end of the assessment period
the authorities make another shot; and now mark what
happens. They find that since their last valuation prices
have advanced, new railways have been made, cultivation
has been intensified—or might be intensified, under a little
pressure; and, after the due application of tests of all kinds,
geological, botanical, hydrographical, meteorological, arboricultural,
etc., it is discovered that land and farmer can bear
an extra 30 per cent. or so on the old assessment.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We may assume the Settlement Officer to be a
scrupulously honest and painstaking public servant.
Let us assume that his knowledge of agriculture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and local conditions is equal to his devotion. Still
his responsibility is almost too great for the wisest
and most zealous official. It is his official duty
to raise as much as he decently can for the Government,
whether he calls the sum tax or rent or share
of profits. Against his decision there can be no
resistance and no practicable appeal. The cultivator
is not in reality a free agent in the new bargain,
and if he protests that the payment is beyond his
income, he is informed that, being incapable of
cultivating his own land to the highest advantage,
he must learn better or go.</p>

<p>Usually he does neither. In most cases he has
no opportunity for learning better, and he cannot,
or does not, go. He borrows. An anonymous
writer once attacked me with scorn for saying that
a large proportion of cultivators in Bombay were
receiving no net income, no profits for themselves
at all; they were simply existing on their land, and
for their few clothes, medicines, and family festivals
they were trying to get outside work, selling their
family bangles, or appealing to the money-lender on
the off-chance that a “bumper crop” might enable
them to pay something some day.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“According to Mr. Nevinson,” cried this anonymous
writer, “the ryots in the Presidency are such simpletons as
to go on cultivating land, their income from such cultivation
being always equalled by their cultivation expenses. Why,
then, do they cultivate at all, when obviously by abandoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the land and its profitless cultivation they could at once
better their position by devoting to other work the time and
labour they now expend on cultivation.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The question is worthy of the old professorial
economists, who never went beyond books for knowledge,
and settled the affairs of human nature in
their studies by their own conceptions of reason.
They used to tell us that, when one trade failed,
the labour devoted to it became absorbed in other
occupations. I have often wondered, if their trade
of theorizing failed, in what other occupation their
labour would become absorbed. A large number of
our Indian officials spend nearly the whole of their
time dealing with abstractions and cases on paper,
their feet under their writing-tables. The increasing
pressure of the daily routine drives them further
and further from reality, and one might suppose
that this anonymous writer had never been face to
face with a peasant in his home, or known anything
of the peasant’s clinging to the land, or ever been
thrown out of work and compelled to face starvation
for a single day himself.</p>

<p>What I said was perfectly accurate. The Indian
cultivator will cling to his land even when he makes
no profit beyond his subsistence wage. I believe
the same to be true of peasant proprietors or small
holders in nearly every country; certainly it is true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
in France, Russia, and Ireland, for I have known
cases in all three countries. So the Indian cultivator,
when he makes no profit and is called upon for
increased assessment or his daughter’s marriage,
does not at once set off to Bombay and become a
watchmaker or a docker, as economists think he
ought. As I said, he borrows. Usually he goes to
the village money-lender (banya or sowkar), and
receives advances at 12 to 30 per cent. per annum,
according to his character in the village. In reality,
I think, the money-lender speculates on the chance
of a “bumper crop” every few years, but in the last
resort he may sell up the cultivator through the
civil courts in Bombay, or convert him into his
own labourer to work the land for him on a subsistence
wage. In hopes of saving the ryot from
this extortion, the Government has devised agricultural
banks and other schemes for advancing
loans at the reasonable interest of 5 per cent., and
in course of time this benefit will probably increase.
But at present the economists, as usual, have made
the mistake of omitting the uncertain element in
man, and he yet continues to prefer his familiar
old money-lender to the most advantageous Government
loan. In some districts I have heard there
is a national feeling about it, but I suppose the
chief reason really is that the Government claims
its interest down on the nail for a fixed day, whereas
the village money-lender can often be cajoled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
bribed, frightened, or persuaded, like a reasonable
tailor, to put off the dreaded moment of demand.</p>

<p>The actual cash amount of the assessment is not
such an important question to the cultivator as its
proportion to his income. The figures given for
Deccan villages by Mr. Vaughan Nash in his
“Family Budgets,” show an assessment of about
two shillings an acre.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Many of the villages I
visited were probably poorer, being in the mountains,
but the average assessment tax in them
appeared to be only a little over one shilling an
acre, and sometimes as low as fivepence, on an
average holding of twenty acres. The assessment,
as I said, has now to be paid in cash on a certain
day, often while the crop is still growing. If payment
is not made, everything the peasant possesses
can be seized and sold by the Revenue authorities—house
and land, plough and oxen, bedding and
cooking pot. That is the money-lender’s opportunity,
and in practice it is usually the money-lender
who hands over the cash. If he refuses
a further advance, the Government is compelled
either to cancel the debt (which is now often done
in famine seasons), or to suspend the debt till
next harvest (which is frequently done, but only
puts off the evil day), or to sell the peasant up,
which usually yields a very small price, and sometimes
produces serious disturbances, as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Deccan riots of 1875, when the money-lenders
were burnt out and driven from the village.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As is well known, nearly all the land in the
Bombay Presidency, and far the greater part of
Madras, is held on this “ryotwari” system, or
peasant tenantry to the State, there being no intermediary
at law between the Government and the
cultivator, though the money-lender often acts as
such. In many other provinces the land is owned
by landlords, or “zemindars,” much as in our own
country, and the revenue is taken from them,
though it is ultimately paid by the cultivator. In
Bengal the zemindars were granted a Permanent
Settlement in 1793, which fixed the demands of the
State so that no further assessment has been instituted,
and revenue stands at an almost constant
figure. The Rent Acts of 1859 and 1885 aimed
at protecting the cultivators from the usual abuses
and extortions of the landlord system, but whether
the Permanent Settlement, which, of course, involves
a great loss of revenue to Government, is justified
or not by its results—whether the greater prosperity
and intelligence of Bengal arise from the moderation
and fixity of the assessment, or are due to climate,
race, and enterprise, is one of those questions that
are argued between officials and educated Indians
with a kind of perpetual motion. A similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Permanent Settlement for the whole of India was
proposed by Lord Canning just before his death in
1862, but finally abandoned twenty years later, after
laborious discussion.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>On leaving even small and beautiful cities like
Poona you pass through a zone where the inhabitants
enjoy the health and suffer from the scrappiness
of suburbs. Here they live partly by gardening,
partly by burning lime or working in the town,
and their houses have a touch of urban refinement.
The ceilings and the tops of the walls, for
instance, are hung with those garish pictures of
religious subjects—the adventures of Krishna, and
other scenes—which would provide so suitable a
market for German art. But the suburbs are short,
within a few miles you enter the heart of the
country, and in his primeval village are brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>face to face with the ryot—the cultivator of the
soil, the basis of the Indian Empire, the one man
for whom, or at least by means of whom, all the
rest of the intricate machinery exists, from the
splendours of Simla down to the office of the “Remembrancer
of Legal Affairs,” and the “Finger-print
Bureau,” in Poona’s residential quarter, or to
Lord Kitchener’s reviews in the Poona cantonment.</p>

<p>In my various journeys within a circle of twenty
miles round the city, I found the ryot much what I
had expected—gentle-mannered, patient, hardy, and
incredibly thin, living with his family in a clean but
dusty hut, furnished with little beyond a few brass
pots and dishes. All day he was working in his
field, and he gathered for converse at evening—“cow-dust
time,” as they call it—on the steps
of the village temple, in which a vague red image
represents the idea of helpful strength—something
like Hercules or the Archangel Michael; for it
is the same Maruta who helped Rama on his
wandering search for the beloved Sita.</p>

<p>I have never heard even the most frigid official
speak evil of the ryot. As the best patronizers in
the world, we find in the ryot a most suitable object
for our characteristic capacity. Hard-working, sober,
and reverential beyond the dreams of country
parsons, he is exactly the sort of being to whom we
enjoy extending the kindly and protective sympathy
due from a squire to his villagers. Just as in Natal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
or Nigeria every one is ready to commend the untutored
savage and pat his curly head provided he
remains savage, so in India even the Anglo-Indian
will admit a distant affection for the poor dear ryot,
and regrets the good old times when hardly an
Indian of them all made pretence to further education
or equality. But education and equality are the
two things that undermine our accustomed pedestal,
and the thought of a time when we might no longer
be required to exercise our national function of
patronage fills us with dismay.</p>

<p>The crop and the assessment are the two kindred
and vital points in the ryot’s earthly life, as distinguished
from the life of his spirit. In the Deccan,
as in all parts of India, the crop is simply a matter of
opportune rainfall, and when I was in Poona there
had been no good crop for fifteen years. That
autumn the prospect was a little worse than ordinarily
poor, though the main famine district of the year was
in the United Provinces, far away north. Preparations
for a serious famine had to be made already,
for, as Sir William Hunter estimated, one-fifth of
India’s population—say sixty million souls—are
perpetually living on insufficient food, apart from
famines; and, partly owing to the export-trade, the
villagers no longer store grain to meet an evil day,
nor do they possess cash to purchase grain from
other parts of the country. So when the pinch
of scarcity comes, the land-owning or land-taxing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Government alone stands between them and starvation;
and, indeed, the Government prides itself at all
times upon its service as protector of the poor,
especially against other landlords and money-lenders.
There is always a good deal of justice in the claim,
even when the Government, having first tempered
the wind, proceeds to shear the lamb. But famine
is the special opportunity for Government beneficence.
All officials then vie with each other in the
thankless labour of holding the bodies and souls of
thousands together, and within a month of his landing
as Governor of Bombay, Sir George Clarke had all
his preparations ready for relief works, terracing of
hills, sinking of wells, and remission (not merely
suspension) of the year’s assessment money.</p>

<p>Of the assessment and of famine I had heard and
read a great deal before, but one set of grievances,
closely connected with both, was new to me. It arose
from the Forest Laws—a subject we hardly consider
in England unless we are thinking of William Rufus
or the game-preserves of kilted City Fathers in the
Highlands. The present strict system of forest
preservation was, I believe, instituted after the
terrible famine of 1877-78, with the admirable intention
of restoring the rainfall. In old times the
village communities maintained a tract of communal
forest for grazing and fuel near each village, just as
they did formerly in England, and still do in Russia.
An ancient Indian custom set aside an acre of grazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
for every acre of cultivated land. But under our
rule the influence of village communities was to
a great extent destroyed, because we remembered
nothing like it in England, and the plough was
suffered to encroach upon the forest till there was
a real danger that no forest would be left and the
rains would cease. Nothing could be better than
the intention of the Forest Department in checking
the process called “denudation,” but instead of
restoring the control of forests to the villagers themselves
under definite rules of maintenance, they centralized
the managements as bureaucrats will, declared
uncultivated land to be Government forest, prohibited
wood-gathering or cattle-grazing without payment,
let out the grass and timber by auction to contractors,
and entered the proceeds to the advantage of the
Department. There is no denying the benefits to
Government and the contractors. The destruction
of forest is checked, hay and fuel are supplied to the
cavalry cantonments and cities, and the Department
(including Burma) contributes a net sum of about
£800,000 a year to the Indian exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Could
anything be more desirable?</p>

<p>“But how about my buffalo?” cries the thin
ryot of the valley. As Mr. Vaughan Nash said in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>his book on the Famine, the buffalo is quite as
necessary to the Indian peasant as a boat to a fisherman.
Buffaloes are necessary for work on the fields,
manure for the soil, and milk for the family, to say
nothing of fuel and flooring. No one who, like
myself, has lived much in Kaffir huts with cow-dung
floors, or has cooked on the veldt for weeks together
with cow-dung as fuel, will make light of such uses.
But still, when wood is to be had, only a fool uses
cow-dung for cooking or even for flooring. In the
Indian forests, wood is to be had, but the Forest
Laws forbid the people to use it, and they are driven
to floor and cook with the cow-dung that ought
rightly to go as manure for the fields.</p>

<p>But the grazing is the chief difficulty, now that
the old communal lands are being swallowed up
by the Forest Department. The villagers may earn
a few pence by cutting grass for the contractor
who carts it away to the city, but the hungry
buffaloes look up and are not fed. Even where
a grazing allotment is made, it is too small, and
I was in a village fifteen miles from Poona where
the twelve families could afford to keep only one
buffalo between them, and they had to pay rent
to the Forest Department for the right of grazing
that one buffalo and a few goats upon little patches
of the vast hillsides, all of which they regarded as
the common lands of the village for centuries past.
The rent, no doubt, was very small, probably only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
a few shillings a year for the buffalo and goats, but
the village income was very small too.</p>

<p>From the bureaucracy’s well-intentioned schemes,
other peculiar results arise which perhaps did not
occur to those who framed the laws. One case,
for instance, was mentioned to me by several
villagers as a kind of typical or proverbial absurdity.
A waggon broke its wheel and the owner began
to mend it. The village police, hearing the hammer,
arrested him under Section E, paragraph 109 (or
some such clause) of the Forest Laws, upon the
charge of practising carpentry within a mile of the
forest limit. In his innocence, he asked what he
ought to have done to get his waggon home over
the few hundred yards to his door. He was
informed that he ought to have walked into Poona,
twenty or thirty miles away, discovered the office
of the Forest Department, waited till the proper
official, who would very likely be in the country,
returned to town, stated his case, and asked for a
legal certificate authorizing him to cut timber for the
repairs of his wheel on the spot. Then, with good
luck, within a week or ten days from the accident,
he might have found himself in a position to drive
his waggon home in accordance with bureaucratic
regulations. I believe, however, that this rule has
now been modified, and that the man would only
have to hunt a forest ranger for permission. But
take another grievance, which recalls childhood’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
memories of the Norman Conquest. The ryot’s
little wealth of crop and stock is continually exposed
to wild beasts—deer, wolves, panthers, and boars—just
as our farmers’ crops are exposed to hares and
rabbits. But under the Arms Act, the ryot has
little chance of killing them himself. His duty is
to walk into the nearest town and report the
presence of a wild beast to the police. The police
look round for an Englishman who wants something
to kill. Frequently they advertise for one
in the local papers, and usually they have not to
wait very long. Off goes the Englishman—rifle,
tiffin-basket, boy, bedding, and all. But in the
meantime it is not improbable that the wild beast
has walked away, or founded a whole new family
even worse than himself. At the best, it is just
possible that the Englishman may miss him.</p>

<p>While I was in India a movement was started
for the protection of the helpless ryot from deer.
In many parts of the country, especially in Rajputana
and the Central Provinces, you may frequently
see herds of deer and antelopes browsing upon the
standing crops, to the great loss of the cultivator.
It was alleged that the increase of deer was due
to the gradual reduction of tigers (which are nature’s
own corrective), and the proposal was to discourage
the slaughter of tigers by withdrawing the Government
reward of £3 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a head, or even to forbid
the sport of shooting tigers unless they were proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
by experience to be man-eaters. Personally, I think
the latter regulation would be good, for the deer
would be reduced, the crops protected, and the
tigers increased. But I am not sure how far a ryot,
in the interests of agriculture, would approve of a
regulation that allowed one tiger one man.</p>

<p>The main grievances of the ryot against the
Forest Department may be seen briefly stated in
a memorial presented to the Governor of Madras
by the cultivators of eight villages in the Salem
district, April, 1908. The Forest Department
proposed to reserve the Anurath Hills in the
neighbourhood of the villages, and the memorial
protested that already there was not much waste
land for grazing, and hardly enough land even for
cultivation. To reserve the hills would also deprive
the villagers of wood and fuel, and inflict a kind
of double assessment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“You settle our lands,” said the memorial, “every thirty
years and raise the assessment. To pay this assessment we
ought to cultivate our land with the aid of good manure.
To have manure we must maintain sufficient stock of cattle.
When we enter the forest to procure fodder, you demand
permit fees; thus you demand double payment (one in the
shape of land assessment and the other in the shape of forest
fees) for the lands we cultivate.”</p>
</div>

<p>The memorial went on to say that, owing to
the rigour of forest administration, the villagers,
to protect themselves, had to bribe the subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
officials of the Forest Department, and it concluded
with the words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“We lead a peaceful life. It is the policy of the Government
to keep every ryot in a contented and happy state.
But in order to secure additional forest revenue, if you
permit the Forest officials to enclose an additional reserve
against our wishes, you will create much heart-burning and
discontent against the Government.”</p>
</div>

<p>But let us put things at their best. Let us
suppose there is neither drought, nor famine, nor
plague. Let us assume that the assessment has
been paid without borrowing, and the Forest Laws
observed or evaded, that wild beasts have been
killed, and yet the deer have not damaged the
crops. Let us suppose that the ryot’s income
reaches the highest possible average, which Lord
Curzon calculated at £2 a year per head of the
population, including all the rich merchants, bankers,
and landowners. It is next to impossible that the
average income in any village could be as much as
that, but let us assume it is. Still it remains at
only half what is spent per head in England every
year on drink alone. It represents a standard of
poverty which we can hardly conceive—a level
where every fraction of a farthing counts. And
yet I found within twenty miles of Poona a group
of villages where the ryots clubbed together of their
own accord to hire a schoolmaster at a salary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
eight shillings a month. In face of a sacrifice so
astonishing it appeared to me that all the outcries
about the dangers of education in India that were
then filling the speeches of our statesmen and the
columns of the <cite>Times</cite> and Anglo-Indian papers,
might with good hope be accounted vain.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The whole question of land-ownership and the Settlement is very
lucidly discussed in Mr. Theodore Morison’s “Industrial Organization
of an Indian Province,” chapter ii. His general conclusion is that the
Indian system of land-tenure is something intermediate between complete
nationalization and absolute private property. “To the extent of
one-half the State is able to appropriate that unearned increment in
rental incomes which is due to the development of the country. But,
except for this contribution to the public exchequer, the economic
position of the landlord is not affected by the land revenue laws. He
receives rent for the use of the national and indestructible properties of
the soil, and he raises that rent when the growth of population and the
development of the country makes it profitable to bring poorer lands
under cultivation.” In saying this, Mr. Morison is, however, obviously
thinking only of a zemindar or landlord district, such as the United
Province, with which his book chiefly deals.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">The Southern City</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Madras, the most Oriental of the great Indian cities,
is well known to English people as the first foothold
of Elizabethan merchants, the fortress of Clive,
and the coral strand where little English boys used
to convert their patient bearers. But apart from
these associations, the mother city of Southern India
has a peculiar character of her own. Her reformers
talk with confidence of the dry light of reason in
Madras. They pride themselves on the logic and
unimpassioned judgment of her mind. They point
to the neighbouring State of Mysore to show what
Southern Indians like themselves can do in the way
of political advancement, and to Travancore as the
most highly educated part of India—the State where
women have most freedom, both to gather knowledge
and to enjoy their home or leave it. The whole of
South India, but especially the city of Madras itself,
they regard as a reserve of intellectual force, always
ready to support the new spirit that has appeared in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
the north and west, and destined ultimately to take
the lead in the general movement of reform.</p>

<p>Certainly I noticed signs of a practical intelligence
that might be called dry. Hour after hour,
on a steaming afternoon, I listened to the Madras
members of the municipal corporation arguing in
protest against the English members and officials
about the position of standpipes, and the adulteration
of ghee with oil, and of rice with sand, while
the President, in the broadest Scots, kept calling on
them to address the chair, or declaring their motion
lost. When I was in Madras also, the Decentralization
Commission, under Mr. Charles Hobhouse, at
that time Under-Secretary for India, began its
session, and the educated citizens followed the
chaotic windings of its questions and evidence with
minute accuracy, all the more eager, perhaps, because
Mr. Romesh Dutt, the national authority on Indian
economics, was among the Commissioners. It was
even more significant that Madras, the devoted
home of Hinduism and of Vishnu’s worshippers,
should have steadily chosen her leading Mohammedan
citizen as her representative upon the
Viceroy’s Council. One may call this a sign of
practical intelligence and the dry light of reason,
because they could not have chosen a better member
than Nawab Syed Mohammed, descendant of our
old enemy Tippoo Sultan, and their deep sense of
religion did not deter them from the choice. Calm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
modest, and generally silent but for a few definite
words thrown into a discussion, he seemed an ideal
member for any Council.</p>

<p>Yet, though the boast of reason’s dry light is
justified, the pervading tone of Madras, and probably
of all Southern India, is not practical logic, but
imaginative religion. One sometimes finds the two
things in attractive combination. I had gone out
one early morning to visit the god in his beautiful
temple at Mailapur, not very far from the widespread
“compounds” of park and garden, where the
happy English and a few rich Indians reside, two or
three miles inland from the sea and the jumbled
“Black Town” of crowded natives. There, as I
stood by the edge of the temple tank covered with
the lotus, I came upon an elderly Hindu reading
at the door of his modest home. The verandah was
partly arranged as a stable for the sacred cow, partly
laid with mats for beggars, wanderers, or religious
teachers who might be seeking a shelter for the night.
The man had bathed in the tank and washed his
only garment of a long cotton cloth, as he did every
morning himself, following the cleanly and chivalrous
Indian custom. He was a schoolmaster, with
a fixed salary of £3 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a month. Upon this
he mainly supported his sons and their wives and
children, all of whom lived in his house, under the
direction of his widowed mother, who arranged
which of the married couples should occupy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
married quarters in turn, as there was not room
to supply married quarters for all. In gratitude for
her services, and in reverence for motherhood,
“which is the centre of human life,” he told me
how every morning members of the family washed
the widow’s feet and covered them with flowers, as
though they were the feet of a divinity.</p>

<p>The day being a religious holiday—a festival of
Shiva, destroyer and healer—he was spending the
quiet hours in meditating upon God, and reading a
large volume of Professor William James’s “Principles
of Psychology.” In religion he was inclined
to the Monist view that the spirit of man is identical
in essence with the spirit of God, but admitted that
he felt no violent enmity towards the Dualists, who
maintain a difference in essence. He wore on his
forehead the three strong lines of white and vermillion,
which represent the footprint of Vishnu,
the maintainer of existence, and pronounce the
wearer to be a reverential servant to the god’s commands.
But, here again, he felt no enmity towards
the worshippers of Shiva, who draw three parallel
lines in grey or yellow earth across their brows.
His true interest lay in the region of philosophy,
and as a Monist his conception of the universe
hardly differed from Spinozism, unless it be said
that he went beyond Spinoza in his belief in a
universal Consciousness, the subtle waves of which
he could himself universally perceive if only his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>mind were not too gross an instrument of perception.
All through his life he had striven to purify
and etherialize that instrument by clean feeding
and the practice of concentration. He had never
touched flesh or strong drink or tobacco. By
practising for an increasing time every day, he
had been able to fix his mind on eternal truths
with such absorption that the transitory things no
longer disturbed his meditation, and he had acquired
new and subtle powers, enabling him dimly to
perceive a consciousness in the air and so-called
inanimate objects. He could sometimes even feel
the impalpable workings of Karma—the influence
of man’s reputed good or evil deeds working upon
his own destiny, and affecting even the infinitesimal
atoms of the universe.</p>

<p>He now longed to retire from the world, to
lay aside his sacred thread—the triple thread of
Brahmans—and devote to contemplation the few
years left. But the size of his patriarchal household,
and the necessity of making that 16<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a
week restrained him, and, of course, his motives
were laudable. Nevertheless, as usually happens,
it would have been better for himself and his
family if he had flung away his obvious duties
and followed the call of his higher thoughts alone.
For as I came away after receiving sour milk, and
the usual pan leaf enclosing a bit of spice and beetel-nut
to chew, one of his sons—an inferior telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
clerk—stole after me to ask my advice about £2,
which he had forwarded to a swindling Trust
Company that plays the confidence trick with
Congo Bonds and other ludicrous impostures. It
was pitiful to think that the £2, now probably
greasing the dirty works of Belgian brothels and
gambling-hells, might have secured the philosopher
nearly three weeks’ leisure from his school-teaching
for the contemplation of the Monistic Essence, and
but for his sense of family duty his son could not
have squandered it.</p>

<br>

<p>But among the common multitudes of the city,
the dry light of this philosophic spirit is not conspicuous.
It has never arisen, and the religious
fervour of their existence remains misty, dark, and
warm. Relics of far older beliefs mingle with their
Hinduism. In one of their burning-grounds I met
a little procession carrying milk in brazen bowls to
wash the bones of the dead burnt yesterday, and to
pour an offering for the spirit’s consolation. Round
another grave a group of mourners were seated,
offering yellow flowers, and pouring water on the
dust that was alive last week. Two of them beat
cymbals, and at long intervals a man raised a large
white conch-shell to his lips and blew a melancholy
note. Why will not the dead listen when they are
called? Why will they not give one word of
answer to trumpet, prayers, and love? And all
the while, one of the mourners, regardless of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>world, swayed to and fro chanting the undying
truth that man must die, for life is a shadow, and
he vanishes; those who stand beside a grave know
this truth undying; they know that they too shall
vanish like a shade, yet they go back to the city and
sin, and sin again, forgetting that they too shall
vanish like a shade. So the lamentation went on,
the water was poured, the milk was offered, the
conch-shell sounded its last vain summons, and the
living returned to their life of numbered days. In
the middle of Africa I have witnessed a yearning
ceremonial exactly the same. It was the same that
brought Electra out to Agamemnon’s tomb. It is
the same that one may still see on All Saints’ Day,
in any primitive region of Europe, and in the cemeteries
of Paris herself. For it springs from the
common longing of all mankind not to be forgotten,
and, if only it were possible, never to forget.
The same truth has been beautifully expressed with
regard to the Bulgarian villagers of Macedonia by
Mr. Brailsford in his book upon that country:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The real religion of the Balkans is older and more
elemental than Christianity itself; more permanent even
than the Byzantine rite. It bridges the intervening centuries
and links in pious succession the modern peasant to his
heathen ancestor, who wore the same costumes and led the
same life in the same fields. It is based on a primitive
sorrow before the amazing fact of death, which no mystery
of the Resurrection has ever softened. It is neither a rite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
nor a creed, but only that yearning love of the living for the
dead which is deeper than any creed.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the service of the living, the fervent religious
spirit of the South takes other forms, some of adoration,
some only ritualistic. Now and then it turns
to practical utility—the hope that religion will bring
some temporal good to the worshipper. There is
a belief almost universal, I suppose, in our own
country and in Europe that religious thoughts,
prayers, and observances ensure outward well-being,
health, protection, or prosperity of some kind. In
the East it is probably not so common, for religion
is there elevated to its proper sphere of the inmost
soul, where the comforts and external advantages of
life disappear into insignificance compared with the
glory that is revealed. But, deeply religious as the
Hindu mind can be, I found the people in the streets
of Madras directing religious ecstasy to the rather
trivial object of healing disease, much as though they
had been mere Faith-healers or Christian Scientists.
The festival of Shiva lasted three or four days, and
at any hour of the burning sunlight, one could meet
little processions parading through Black Town with
some sort of shrine or image, accompanied by pipes
and drums, dancing and praying crowds. The sick
were caught up from the doors into the pious orgies
and with holy revelry danced themselves into a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of ecstatic self-forgetfulness which was unquestionably
wholesome. Few diseases, I think, could stand
against such treatment, provided only that the
patient survived. It might be tried with miraculous
results in the streets of our bath-chair watering-places.
But if the triumph and proof of religion
depended on mere miracles of healing the sick and
raising the dead, it would be a pity to waste a
minute’s thought upon the subject.</p>

<p>Far more fruitful was the unmixed and disinterested
adoration that thronged the temples in
the evening. One night I found myself at a beautiful
temple in the southern part of the town. It is a
Vishnu temple: here is his tank, here his chariot.
But the people there were celebrating the festival of
Shiva all the same, and among the deep orange
columns of the external portico, dim figures in white
or Indian red moved silently about, hardly revealed
in the purple night by rare lanterns and tiny lamps.
Being accompanied by a Brahman who was guardian
of the temple, I was admitted through brazen doors
into a vast courtyard leading up to the inner shrine
on which no alien may look. Here the worshippers
stood in an almost continuous crowd, silent, slowly
moving in dubious obscurity. I caught one gleam
of yellow light on prostrate forms among columns
beyond, but a priest led me quietly into a vast
chamber at the side, where were stabled the mystic
figures of a dragon large as life, a flying kite and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
elephant, all awaiting the great day when the god
takes to his car and moves in glory through the
streets, seated beneath the mystic tree, which also
was standing there. From a hidden and cavernous
safe the priest then displayed a flashing wealth of
emeralds and rubies, unnumbered as the Milky Way
and, possibly, surpassing their own value by their
holiness. Disappearing for a while, after shutting
the safe, he returned with a pink garland, thick as a
liner’s hawser, and hung it round my neck, where
already two white garlands hung, for I had been
received with honour by a political club just before
I came. But this new pink garland nearly touched
my feet. It had been an offering to the shrine,
and came to me cold from the neck of the god
himself.</p>

<p>Thus sanctified and adorned, I passed back into
the throng of worshippers in the temple court, and
presently felt among them a peculiar stir of excitement,
which I naturally attributed to my unusual
appearance, just visible in the darkness. But when
I was conducted by the Brahman to a large private
house overlooking the precincts, for the first time in
India I failed to receive the usual Hindu welcome.
The rooms and courtyards glimmered with little
lamps. Seated in the verandah before the door, a
band of pipers, blowing as they pleased, drove dull
care away—far away, one hoped, for her sake.
Gods, kites, and elephants of painted alabaster were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
arranged in neat rows upon the table of an inner
room, and little girls, dressed in the gorgeous silks
and embroideries of Southern India, tended them
with lights and flowers. But the master of the
house, himself a temple guardian, politely expressed
an unwillingness to receive the foreigner, and when
I turned back among the excited crowd that swarmed
round me under the temple colonnade, I heard for
the first time the wild shout of “Bande Mataram!
Bande Mataram!” (Hail to the Motherland!)
rising on every side. If a Brahman had not been
my guide, I should have supposed the outcry to be
due to religious indignation. He told me afterwards
it was in compliment to my Liberal opinions.
But I think it was not in compliment to my English
clothes, which were far more conspicuous than my
Liberal opinions.</p>

<p>There is no part of India where the anti-English
feeling was less to be expected than in Madras.
Here the Hindu is seen at his mildest, here he asks
least of this fleeting world, and accepts destiny with
the gentlest quietude. If ever there was a country
easy to govern, it should be Southern India; and in
time past no part of India has surrendered itself more
unreservedly to British rule or trusted more confidently
to British justice. Much of this friendliness
has been due to the influence of our missionaries,
represented by some very remarkable men in Madras.
I do not know their statistics of conversion:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
I think they must be very low, especially as the
Bishop of Madras, during my visit, was expressing
his despair of ever converting educated Indians,
and was urging his clergy to pay attention only to
the lowest castes. But the missionary influence
upon education itself has been very large. It has
created one famous and excellent institution, and a
popular restaurant besides. It is chiefly the cause,
I suppose, of the widespread knowledge of English
among all classes in the city. More than this, I
found that in Madras and other parts of India, as I
had seen in Nigeria, Central Africa, and South
Africa—even in Macedonia and Armenia also—the
missionaries do maintain a certain standard of justice
to the credit of the “White Man,” or “European,”
and that the oppressed and destitute, even among
the classes below the protection of any caste, do
actually turn to them with the assurance of finding
a quality of mercy and sympathetic understanding
not very remote from their profession of brotherhood
in Christ. It is easy to join in the taunt about
“Famine Christians,” and to point to the curve of
conversions varying directly with the price of food.
But if we were starving, I suppose most of us would
gladly profess any religion in the world for a prospect
of regular meals, and the important thing is that by
the missionaries no class is neglected or left to feel
itself outcast from humanity—not even the poor
fishers on the sands south of the town, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
dwellers in savage huts that let at fourpence a
month, and are sublet among different families.</p>

<p>Missionaries have done much, and so has a succession
of good governors, from the time of Sir
Thomas Munro, to whose memory the temple bell
still rings a special chime before service. Our own
people have forgotten him for three generations
now, but I have seen the Hindu women drop their
baskets and bow their heads as they passed his
equestrian statue on “the Island”—an honour
seldom paid to equestrian statues at home. He it
was who reduced the taxes and watered the land and
executed justice; and so his memory lives. Taught
by his example, the people used to recognize that
there were some things we English could do: we
could organize drainage, and build bridges to stand,
and decide quarrels without taking bribes. So they
were content to leave these comparatively unimportant
concerns in our hands, while they devoted
themselves to the only two occupations that matter
much—the growth of food and the worship of God.
If their faith in our peculiar powers is declining,
and they are themselves making new claims upon
government and public life, the change is due to
underlying causes, which are affecting the whole of
India in varying degrees, and have already produced
a new sense of unity in opposition.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the grievance of Anglo-Indian
manners is not peculiar to Madras. The attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of the vulgar among Anglo-Indians towards the
people of the country would be incredible to any
one who had not seen it, and the vulgar are a large
and increasing class. They increase by a kind of
infection, and the deterioration of a new-comer who
has been sent out with the usual instincts of our
educated classes in favour of politeness and decency,
is often as unconscious as it is rapid. The pressure
of his social surroundings is almost irresistible. If he
does not wish to cut himself off altogether from the
society and amusements of his own people, he will
be driven to conform to the code of insolence established
among them. To stand alone against feminine
dislike and masculine views of good-form requires a
toughness of character and an indifference to personal
reputation or advancement which one cannot expect
from many of the young Englishmen and Englishwomen
who come out. These usually spring from a
caste bred upon rather rigid observances, and they
look to the opinion of their own caste almost entirely
for the sanction of conduct. At first they are
astonished that Anglo-Indian opinion not only
permits but imposes so ill-bred a manner in intercourse
with “natives,” but the astonishment soon
wears off, and the infection of arrogance catches
them as a matter of course. The Governor of
Bombay once told me it was impossible to convert
“bounders” into gentlemen by Act of Parliament,
and, unfortunately, that is true; else we might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
enjoy a more enviable reputation in the world. But
I was astonished to find how easily an apparent
gentleman may become entirely the opposite if he
finds himself set up as one of a superior race among
a polite and gentle people, always too much inclined
to submit to rudeness with reverential astonishment.</p>

<p>Dr. Lefroy, the Bishop of Lahore, who for a
quarter of a century has striven with constancy and
some success to restore the higher tradition of our
race, has said that, but for railways, all might be
well. And it is quite true that the commonest and
most flagrant instances of Anglo-Indian vulgarity
are to be found in trains. But that is chiefly
because it is most often in trains that the two races
meet on terms of nominal equality. On almost
every railway journey one sees instances of ill-manners
that would appear too outrageous for belief
at home. But it is the same throughout. In hotels,
clubs, bungalows, and official chambers, the people
of the country, and especially the educated classes,
are treated with an habitual contumely more exasperating
than savage persecution. I gladly admit that
in every part of India I found Englishmen who still
retained the courtesy and sensitiveness of ordinary
good manners. But one’s mere delight in finding
them proved their rarity. Anglo-Indians tell us
constantly that our first thought must be to maintain
our national prestige, and if arrogance will do
it, our prestige is safe. But when I watched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Anglo-Indian behaviour towards Indians themselves,
I often wondered whether prestige is really to be
secured by manners such as we should hardly find
among “bounders” at home. For myself, I should
have thought Lord Morley was right when he said
that “bad manners, overbearing manners, are very
disagreeable in all countries, but India is the only
country where bad and overbearing manners are a
political crime.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Unhappily, the justice of Indian complaints on
this subject was not new to me, when I came to
Madras. Every one finds proofs of it from the
moment of landing in Bombay, and, in fact, even
on board ship. The social estrangement between
the two races rapidly increases after Port Said is left.
But in Madras I found another cause of deep dissatisfaction.
In spite of all I had heard about injustice
in particular cases, in spite of the old demand for police
reform and the separation of the judicial and executive
functions now combined in the District Magistrate,
it was disconcerting to discover a prevailing and
uneasy suspicion that British justice could not safely
be trusted. Certainly, much disquietude had
recently been roused by a few special instances, at
Rawal Pindi, Lahore, and elsewhere. “Killing no
murder, outrage no crime, when Indians are concerned
and Englishmen the culprits”: that was the
common conclusion, and it was not unnatural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>But the suspicion arose from more general and
permanent causes as well. There remains the standing
sense of wrong, because an Englishman has the
right to a different form of trial from an Indian. A
magistrate with power to inflict a two years’ sentence
on an Indian, may inflict only six months on a
European. No Indian may try a criminal case
against a European, and in criminal cases a European
may claim a jury, with a majority of Europeans on
it. Lord Ripon’s attempt gradually to modify these
distinctions is one of the well-remembered events of
his famous Viceroyalty—one of the many reasons
which have endeared his name to India as no other
Viceroy’s is endeared—but his endeavour was
thwarted.</p>

<p>As to the separation of functions, the Viceroy’s
Council, through Sir Harvey Adamson, has lately
(March, 1908) promised an experiment with this
purpose in Eastern Bengal; but in India generally
the District Magistrate who tries cases himself, or
arranges for their trial by his subordinates, also
controls the police, and in nearly all cases the
police bring the charge. The injustice of this
arrangement, with all its opportunities for official
influence on legal decisions, has long been so
obvious that one would have thought the cost of
the change was the only obstacle to it. But while
I did not hear much about the danger of increased
cost, I heard a great deal about the danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
diminished dignity, if the District Magistrate lost
either half of his functions. After a battle of over
half a century, we may hope, however, that this
grievance is now to disappear.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I found that the old scandals
about the police had survived Sir Andrew Fraser’s
commission of inquiry (1902). Promotion still
went in practice by the number of convictions
obtained, and convictions too often depended on
evidence derived by the police from the accused
themselves—so-called “confessions,” extorted by
means which, rightly or wrongly, were spoken of
with horror among the people, and even among
Anglo-Indians. Between his arrest and his sentence
the prisoner was left in the hands of the police,
and at their mercy, thus giving them the opportunity
of compelling him to give evidence to his
own detriment. Wherever I went in India I heard
the same complaint of the unscrupulousness and
corruption of the police. Some of the British police
officers with whom I became intimate, appeared to
be experienced and sympathetic men, struggling
rather hopefully on the side of reform. But the
pay of the ordinary native policeman is so ludicrously
small (from 8<em>s.</em> to 10<em>s.</em> a month), even when the low
scale of wages in India is considered, that the constant
temptation to extortion can hardly be resisted,
especially among a population so indifferent to this
world and so deferential to authority, that even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the innocent will volunteer bribes in hopes of being
left in peace.</p>

<p>The drink question in Madras is much the same
as in the rest of India. In a sense, it is worse
even than in England, for we see one of the most
temperate and frugal populations of the world
gradually taking to drink as a new habit.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The
increase of drink is largely due to education, largely
to the example of Europeans and of Indians lately
returned from Europe; partly, in Madras at all
events, to Christianized Indians who claim the right
of casting off all the old restrictions of Indian
behaviour. As in England, the Government does
not escape its share of blame, owing to the large
revenue derived from the drink trade. The Excise
or “Abkari” Department sells the licences by
auction, the bidding is keen, and it is difficult to
prevent the purchaser of a licence from setting up
business in the most lucrative position he can find.
By a series of resolutions in February, 1890, the
Government of India declared its intention of
reducing the drink traffic, especially by the restriction
of shops. Nevertheless, the traffic has
very largely increased, and if the number of
shops has not increased in proportion, they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
been opened near market places, bathing ghats,
schools, hospitals, temples, factories, and other places
of common resort, where, as Sir Frederic Lely has
said, they serve as “veritable traps to catch the
weak, the thirsty, and the tired.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to define how far the most paternal
of Governments is responsible for the excesses of
its children, to whom it refuses the common rights
of grown men. The evils of the drink traffic in
India were not to be compared with the evils I had
seen in West and Central Africa, nor were they so
pronounced in Madras as in Calcutta. But the
growth of the drinking habit—mainly European in
origin—must be added to the other more prominent
causes of unrest, even among a population so peaceful
and backward as Madras is considered to be in comparison
with Poona. Hatred of drink as something
equally deadly and foreign was one of the causes
why the Swadeshi movement, starting from Eastern
Bengal, had spread in less than two years throughout
the whole country. Of that movement I had already
seen many evidences. In Bombay I had seen the
Indian cotton-mills working against time to meet
the demand for <em>saris</em> and <em>dhotis</em> (women’s and men’s
cloths) free from the taint of foreign profit. And
now in Madras I found the Swadeshi movement
very strong. “None but Swadeshi goods,” “Buy
our Nationalist cottons,” “Try our Bande Mataram
cigarettes,” were the most telling advertisements a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>shop could write up or insert in the native newspapers,
which are particularly strong and excellent
in Madras.</p>

<p>One wealthy Hindu had ventured even in manufacture
to follow the extreme party which said:
“Let the English go their way. We will ask no
share in their government and take none. We will
neither appeal to their law courts nor accept salaries
as their officials. We must pay their taxes, but
otherwise we will forget that these foreigners are
among us at all.” He had determined to set up
a cotton works without the aid even of imported
machinery. Collecting members of the old weaving
caste, he erected a bamboo factory of hand-looms,
where they were turning out the beautiful fabrics
of Indian work, little more expensive than the
English machine-made stuffs and four times as
durable. The experiment is exposed to some of
the dangers of conscious revivals—the dangers of
“Arts and Crafts.” But hand-loom weaving still
retains a quite natural life in many parts of India,
in spite of the British manufacturers’ long endeavours
to kill the Indian weaving industry. When I visited
his simple factory among the palms north of Madras,
he told me he could not keep pace with the demands
of the Hindu women. And if the women who buy
cotton cloth for their <em>saris</em> and children’s bits of
clothing are willing to give a few farthings more
for native and national work, in a district where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
they have to toil all day for a wage of twopence, it
shows that the national spirit, even in philosophic
and devotional Madras, is reaching far beyond the
limits of the class that our own most highly educated
classes taunt and sneer at as “educated Indians.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> This increase is probably shown in the rapid increase of the
Excise Revenue, which rose from £3,742,800 in 1897 to £5,687,820
in 1906. Of the latter sum “country spirits” yielded nearly £3,000,000,
and “toddy” (the popular drink made from the toddy palm), £874,000.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">It was evening, and the sky was full of the deep
and ominous colours of an Indian sunset in the
rains. A hot wind blowing in from the sea threw
the waves in heavy surf upon the sand. Up and
down the long “Marina,” or esplanade, bordered
by a few vast public offices and a few fishermen’s
hovels, the last carriages were bearing home Anglo-Indian
ladies or youths comfortably wearied with
their polo and other games. But on the broad, dry
sand, between the esplanade and the surf, a vast
circle of people was gathered round a little platform
and chair. They were seated by hundreds on the
sand—between four and five thousand of them
altogether—and round the outer edge of the seated
circle hundreds more were standing upright, like the
rim of a flat plate.</p>

<p>When the meeting began their dark and eager
faces could still be seen in the sunset light. The
faces disappeared, and only the brilliant white
turbans and white draperies were visible by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
flicker of a big lamp they had fitted upon the
platform. The waning moon rose late and shapeless
among heavy clouds, and the dark faces reappeared,
outlined in silver; but still the crowd sat on.</p>

<p>All were men, and most of them were young.
They had assembled to show their joy at the release
of Ajit Singh and Lajpat Rai—both inhabitants of
the far-off Punjab, one till lately an unknown youth,
the other till lately hardly known to any one in
Madras, and only known anywhere as a reformer of
Hindu superstitions, a man of austere private life
and inexhaustible liberality to his own people.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Now both had been raised by their deportation and
imprisonment without trial to the position of heroes
and martyrs, and their recent release (Nov. 11,
1907) had been greeted with joy throughout the
country, though not with gratitude; for there is no
great cause for gratitude when a wrong-doer undoes
the wrong.</p>

<p>Through the middle of the crowd came a line
of white-robed students carrying a yellow banner
with a strange device. “Bande Mataram! Bande
Mataram! Hail to the Motherland! we bow
before our mother!” rose the familiar cry from the
thousands seated there. But there was no wild
gesticulation, no frantic excess, such as we might
imagine in a fanatical East. A Trafalgar Square
crowd is more demonstrative and unrestrained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Nor was a single soldier or policeman visible, though
the occasion had been publicly announced as a
meeting of the Extremists. In the audience I was
of course the only European present.</p>

<p>A little boy with head half shaven and a long
tuft of black hair at the back stood up before the
platform, and amid complete silence sang in his
native Tamil the Bengali song of “Bande Mataram,”
which has now become the national song of
India. The music is of that queer Eastern kind,
nasal, quavering, full of turns and twists, such as
one may hear from the Adriatic to Burma, and
very likely beyond. In origin I believe it to be
Persian; at all events I have heard it in highest
perfection on the Persian frontier and sung by
Persian musicians. Usually—in Greek for instance—the
words are rendered difficult to distinguish
owing to the twists and long-drawn phrases, but in
this boy’s singing the words were fairly distinct, and
the repeated cadence gave a certain solemnity.</p>

<p>The words of the song were by a Bengali poet,
Bankim Chandra Chatterji, who introduced it into
his historic novel called “Anandamath,” or “The
Abbey of Joy,” a romance upon the rebellion of
the austere Sanyasi Order against the decaying rule
of the Mohammedans in Eastern Bengal when
Warren Hastings was the real power. The best-known
translation is by Mr. W. H. Lee, late of the
Indian Civil Service. It is fairly close, but English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
cannot reproduce the compression of the original
Sanscrit and Bengali mixed:—</p>

<p>It is obviously too tender for a stirring
“Marseillaise.” There is not enough march and
thunder either in words or tune to enflame the soul
of trampling hosts. The thunder comes in the cry
of “Bande Mataram!” But the tenderness, the
devoted love of country, and the adoration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
motherhood are all characteristic of the Indian
mind.</p>

<p>When this national anthem was finished, the
Tamil poet of Madras recited a lament he had
written for Lajpat Rai at the time of his deportation.
It was the common lament of exiles—the fond
memory of home, the deep attachment to the land
of childhood, the loneliness of life among strangers
and unknown tongues—all very quietly and simply
told. Then by a sudden change, the poet turned
to satire, and described a dialogue between Mr.
John Morley and India, on the subject of Swaraj
or Home Rule:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“You are disunited,” says Mr. Morley; “what have
you to do with Home Rule? You don’t speak the same
language, you haven’t got the same religion; what have
you to do with Home Rule? You cannot fight, you are
too fond of law, you are the victims of education; what
have you to do with Home Rule? You are born slaves,
you prostrate yourselves before the Englishman: what have
you to do with Home Rule? You are seditious, you are
a prairie on fire, you are a barrel of gunpowder, you cry for
the moon, you are not fit for a fur coat; what have you to
do with Home Rule?”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To which India makes firm and dignified reply.
She has tasted freedom, she has learnt from England
herself what freedom is; even John Morley has
been her teacher, and she will not cease to labour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
for Swaraj. Having drunk the nectar of freedom,
can she turn back to the palm-tree “toddy” of a
Government shop, or cease to labour for Swaraj?
She claims the right of other nations, the rights for
which England herself has fought; she claims the
same freedom of person and of speech, and she will
not cease to labour for Swaraj. From north to
south her people are becoming united, from east to
west the cry of “Bande Mataram” goes up, and
slowly the sun of freedom is arising: it may rise
slowly, but India will not cease to labour for
Swaraj.</p>

<p>The chairman rose, and the darkening air
glimmered with the petals of flowers thrown in
handfuls, as the custom is. Round his neck heavy
garlands were hung, pink and white, to match the
lesser garlands which surrounded the photographs
of the two national heroes on the table. He spoke
in English, like all the subsequent speakers till the
last. One felt at once how great a contribution to
Indian unity the English rule makes in the gift of
a common language which all educated men can
understand, while even in Madras alone four
distinct native languages are spoken. He summarized
the history of the last year of suspicion,
repression, deportation, imprisonment, flogging of
boys and students for political causes, and the
Seditious Meetings Act. It was all done without
passion or exaggeration, and he ended with a simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
resolution calling on the Government to repeal the
deportation statute as contrary to the rights which
England had secured for herself under the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habeas
Corpus</i>.</p>

<p>Four speakers supported the resolution, and
all spoke with the same quiet reasonableness, so
different from our conception of the Oriental mind.
But for clapping of hands, and occasional shouts of
“Bande Mataram!” or “Jai!” (literally “Victory!”
or “Long live So-and-so!”), the immense crowd
remained equally calm. There was no frenzy, no
disorder, no excitement, beyond intense interest and
desire to leave no word unheard. If a speaker was
just a shade too emotional the crowd laughed a
little scornfully, just as an English crowd does.
They laughed when one speaker—a well-known
writer and journalist of Madras—just overstepped
the limits in recalling, with tears in his voice, those
happy days when as a student he had sucked the
enthusiasm for freedom from John Morley’s own
books, and had learnt to regard him as one of the
gods of literature and liberty, in the same great
pantheon with Mill and Burke and Milton. The
crowd knew the man was in earnest, and they
applauded, but they laughed just a little scornfully.
For the rest, the speaking was average straightforward
stuff, free from flowers, and even free
from quotations, which are the besetting tendency
of many Indian minds. Indeed, I remember only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
one quotation—just a hint at a parody on Mark
Antony’s speech, with John Morley and the Liberal
Government as the honourable men.</p>

<p>Only Anglo-Indians could have called the
speeches seditious. To a common type of Anglo-Indian
mind any criticism of the Government, any
claim to further freedom, is sedition. But though
this was avowedly a meeting of Extremists, the
claim in the speeches was for the simple human
rights that other peoples enjoy—the right to a voice
in their own affairs, and in the spending of their
own money. As to the increased suppression and
persecution now overhanging them, they might well
be driven to despair. Other grievances they had
long known, and ever since Lord Curzon came to
India their complaints had been augmented. But
they had always kept a belief in England’s respect
for personal rights and freedom, till Mr. Morley, of
all statesmen, came to overthrow it. What was left
to hope for now?</p>

<p>So the meeting went on, till four speakers had
spoken long, and the late moon was moving up
among the clouds and stars. Then a new speaker
rose—tall, dark, and aged, with clearly cut features,
and a shaven head. His dress was of deep salmon-coloured
cotton—saffron, with a tinge of red—and
in one hand he held a wanderer’s staff, symbolic of
control over thought, speech, and action. Once he
had been a rich man, a barrister, a councillor, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
leader of public life. Now he had given away
all he possessed. He had discarded the mark of
worship and the sacred thread. Having said farewell
to family and friends, to business, politics, and all
transitory things, he had set off with only a staff
to wander through India, begging his bread and
teaching the divine realities, on which he meditated
day and night. To this meeting he had come, not
to discuss mortal justice or the British rule—things
that hardly throw a shadow on the radiance of
eternity—but only to say that in his wanderings
he had met with Lajpat Rai, and had found in him
a saintly human soul, simple-hearted, austere, and
regardless of possessions. He spoke in his childhood’s
Tamil, and when he had finished speaking
he went upon his way, while the meeting dispersed,
and dying shouts of “Bande Mataram!” mingled
with the roaring of the surf.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">The Floods of Orissa</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The holy region of Orissa, where stand the temples
of Juggernath, “Lord of the World,” and of Tribhuvaneshwar,
less famous but “Lord of Three
Worlds” all the same, needs what wealth of holiness
it has got, for its earthly fortunes are small. The
ancient Uriya people live there, speaking a strange
and separate language, though it is said to be near
akin to an ancient Sanscrit form, and using a script
like wire netting or a series of circles in a row. In
the southern district near Ganjam they are still
counted as part of the Madras Presidency, but all
the rest of their country is now limited to Bengal,
and its officials are responsible to the Lieutenant-Governor
in Calcutta. The greater part of the land
is held by Tributary Chiefs and Rajahs, under the
control of a Political Agent, but a good deal is owned
by ordinary zemindars or landlords who sublet to
peasants much in the usual way, come under the
authority of the usual Commissioners and Collectors
of the Civil Service, and about two-thirds of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
pay a land-tax or rent to Government, nominally
fixed every thirty years, because they are not included
in the Permanent Settlement of Bengal. There are
also a few cultivators holding direct from Government.</p>

<p>So far the peasants of Orissa are not worse off
than other people who have to live at the mercy of
landowners. Their special hardship comes from the
nature of the country and from “visitations of God,”
as they are called; though why God’s visitations are
regarded only as evil it is difficult to understand.
Looking inland from the coast, one can see the
beginning of mountain ranges running far into the
interior, and it is there that the Tributary Chiefs and
Rajahs have their territories, there that hill-tribes
live, and wandering elephants abound. But between
the mountains and the sea lies a broad belt of alluvial
plain. It is under British control, but permeated by
uncertain and changeable rivers that issue like wild
animals from the mountains and refuse control of
any kind. Such rivers are the Byturni, a sacred
stream, where millions of pilgrims bathe on their way
down the Grand Trunk Road to the shrine of
Juggernath; the Brahmani, also sacred as its name
denotes, but the chief cause of the present profane
disasters; and the Mahanadi, which threatens the old
capital city of Cuttack, and is sometimes a desert of
sand, sometimes a sea.</p>

<p>In August rain had fallen on the mountains for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
fifteen days and nights without ceasing. Foot by foot
the water in the sacred rivers rose. The islands
disappeared, the broad miles of sand disappeared, the
water reached the edge of the steep mud banks.
Forty years before it had done the same, and old
people began to awake their appalling memories. At
a point called Janardan Ghai, not far from Jenapur,
upon the Brahmani, the embankment had then given
way. The breach had never been properly repaired;
only lately a rubble “bund” or break-water had been
constructed, and now on August 20th, in the middle
of the night, it gave way again. In a dark torrent,
bearing sand and stones with it, the irresistible river
streamed over all the lower lands around, covering
the crops and melting the mud villages away like
ant-heaps. The land is flat, but in the confusion and
darkness the people crowded up any little slope for
safety, or climbed into trees; and one woman had
her baby born as she supported herself among the
branches. When morning came, eight feet of turbulent
water lay over their homes and crops. In
November I could still trace the tidemark of the
flood by tufts of dried grass and drift-wood sticking
in the trees high above my head, as you may do in
early summer on the banks of the Severn.</p>

<br>

<p>When I reached Orissa, the first sign I saw of
the calamity was a band of thirty or forty brown
skeletons crawling towards me as I stood in a garden
at Cuttack. They said they had walked from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>ruined homes beside the Brahmani, looking for work
or food, and hundreds were wandering over the
country in the same way, even as far as Calcutta,
which they counted a fortnight’s walk from there.
Probably they had heard of my arrival, and collected
in the vague hope of some kind of assistance, or
perhaps simply from the instinct that makes most
people fling their misery before any human being
for sympathy. Very likely some were habitual
beggars, worn thin by man’s want of charity, and
taking the advantage of extra numbers to impress
me. A man of stone would have been impressed.
There is no need to describe a brown skeleton—the
projecting ribs and spiny backbone, the legs and
arms like withered sticks, the deep pits at the collarbones,
the loose and crinkly skin. But when a
party of brown skeletons fling themselves flat on the
ground before you, with arms outstretched beyond
their heads and faces rubbing in the dust, when they
take your feet in their bones and lay their skulls
upon your boots, what are you to do? What are
you to do when there are fifteen hundred men,
women, and children only waiting to catch sight of
you that they may make the same irresistible and
hopeless appeal?</p>

<p>I went to the officials. The Collector, under
whose immediate charge the problem of relief came,
was away, but I had a long interview with the Commissioner
in his beautiful home, built on an ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
stone embankment that protects the town from the
river, then hardly visible in the wide expanse of
sand. In the case of both officials I observed the
same difficulties that I found in official life wherever
I came across it in India. Both I believe to have
been entirely honourable and conscientious men,
devoted to their rather monotonous but responsible
work, from which they could gain no great glory
beyond the usual steps of promotion, ending in
retirement to the obscurity of some English golf-links.
One of them, as I heard afterwards, had a
high reputation among his colleagues in the Service
for his solicitude on behalf of the people under his
charge. He studied their language and customs
with enthusiasm, and on one occasion had displayed
conspicuous gallantry in defending them from a
gang of pillaging outlaws, whom he captured single-handed.
Yet he was not the more popular of the
two; and though both were, I think, rather exceptional
public servants, they were regarded with more
hostility than veneration. The curse of ordinary
officials is that reform means change, and change
means trouble. But a conscientious official has the
further curse that, under the constant pressure of
work, he is compelled to spend most of his time
among papers, statistics, and abstractions. To preserve
his sanity under these conditions, the Indian
official is forced to the Club, where he can relax his
mind among his own people, speak his own language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and follow the pursuits that really interest our race,
and so, little by little, the people of the country,
for whose sake alone he is supposed to be there,
appear to him only under the form of cases or
numbers—inhuman subjects, to be avoided in polite
conversation.</p>

<p>The Commissioner, from among his barricades
of reports, abstracts, and regulations, gave me the
official figures of distress, as far as was ascertained
at the end of the third month after the disaster.
They showed an estimated area of 460 square miles
affected by the flood, with a peasant population of
over 300,000; also so many houses swept away, so
much loss in cattle and horses, so many deaths from
cholera after the flood (nearly 2000), and so many
rupees already distributed in relief. From what 1
saw and heard afterwards, I should put the numbers
reduced to a skeleton condition at about 5 per cent.
of the 300,000 population. That does not sound
very much, but if you work it out, it gives 15,000
brown skeletons close to the touch of death by
hunger.</p>

<p>For myself, I cannot think in thousands. I
trust economists and officials to do that for me.
But there was one phrase in the official statement
that appeared quite comprehensible even to me: it
was, “Deaths from starvation, nil.” Nothing could
well be more explicit, yet even that simple assertion
began to look as elusive as other economics when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
went out into the villages and saw the bony corpses
and was told the official cause of death is always
some innocent and unavoidable sickness like cholera
or “bowel complaint,” and that the official mind
has a rooted objection to starvation.</p>

<p>First I went up the line to a place called Balasore,
and late at night visited two Settlement Camps,
where a revision of land-titles was slowly going on,
in view of the next great Settlement which was to
take place in twenty years’ time. It was a recent
idea of Sir Andrew Fraser, Lieutenant-Governor of
Bengal, who with Scottish providence aimed at thus
reducing the work that would await his fourth successor
in office for the year or two before the next
Settlement came. It is true that the present revision
would require further revisions before then, but that
did not matter. With this laudable object, Indian
officials were seated in their tents, and just visible
by lanterns a crowd of forty or fifty small holders
from neighbouring villages were gathered round
them, all clutching their precious title-deeds to their
bosoms. For six days they had been waiting there
from nine in the morning to eleven at night, just
at the time when harvest needed them most. An
official told me it took about a month to complete
the revision in a circle of twenty-one villages, and
the work never stopped but for the rains. Outside
one tent an enterprising shopkeeper had opened
a little store of plantains, rice, and cakes to feed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>the patient crowd. Some were little boys whose
fathers had died, some represented widows. So
under the dispensation of Scottish providence they
waited, and one can only hope that the officials of
eighteen or nineteen years hence will think of them
kindly while enjoying the far-off interest of their
tears.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Next day I returned to Jenapur, and mounted a
large elephant, which, sad to say, could heartily
enjoy a daily meal that would keep any Hindu in
prime condition for six weeks. As upon a watch-tower,
for the next few days I passed up and down
the long line of flat country that had been flooded
beside the Brahmani, sometimes crossing over into
the basin of the Kharsua, another of the uncertain
rivers that alternately save and devastate the land.
Where it was not devastated, the country was thickly
cultivated in little fields of rice, pulse, and a kind of
millet, and the numbers of planted mango-trees gave
it much the same look as an elm-row part of Essex
or the Midlands. Throughout the district rice was
certainly the staple crop, because, though it is so
risky and wants so much water, its yield is magnificent
when it yields at all; and it was one of the
ironies of India that, while here the land had been
ruined by the deluge of rain, on the way up from
Madras I passed through miles on miles of rice
fields where the crops stood dying of drought, or
were already cut as straw for thatch or as fodder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
for the sacred cow. Even here the drought had
been so severe since the flood that the inferior crops
of grain and pulse had failed and could not be used
to alleviate the distress.</p>

<p>But in many of the villages that I visited neither
flood nor drought will matter for many years. Sand
like the seashore had covered crops, and fields, and
boundaries, and homes in one indistinguishable
desert. At the first village I came to after my
elephant had waded through the numerous shallow
channels into which the river had now sunk, a crowd
of naked people—two or three hundred, I suppose—had
assembled round a Government agent who
was issuing little doles of rice. Similar doles had
been issued soon after the disaster three months
before, but otherwise the people had received
nothing from a fatherly Government, because rain
was officially due, and they ought officially to have
lived on the subsidiary crops nurtured by the rain.
But the heavens did not comply with official expectations;
cholera came instead, and now the people
were dying, not, of course, from starvation, but
from “bowel complaints.”</p>

<p>At sight of me upon the elephant, the people
left their doles and flung themselves prostrate upon
the hot sand which had ruined them. Some brought
hoes, and digging three feet down, they showed a
few withered blades from what had once been a
rice-field. To that thickness the sand lay over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
acres and miles of country along the low land
beside the river, and now on the top of the sand
the hungry villagers flung themselves flat in their
appeal. Surely a man who rode an elephant and
wore a helmet, and was white by courtesy, could
save them! What could I do? There were
15,000 living skeletons ready to join in that
prayer, and I had one pocketful of coppers. Rice
was selling at 1½<em>d.</em> a pound; it takes two pounds
a day to feed a man decently, and the full wage
for a working cultivator was twopence in ordinary
times. Where is charity when things are like that?
And where are economics?</p>

<p>As usual, it was the hangers-on to life who
suffered most. Weavers are useful people, and the
village weaver with his wooden hand-loom can
hardly be called a hanger-on in a land where every
man and woman wears several yards of woven
cotton, and washes the garment at least once a day.
But how can a weaver live unless women buy his
stuff? And how can a woman buy his stuff when
she has just sold her doorposts and the family brass
dish to buy food for her children, or to pay the
police tax for the protection of property? She
makes her old rags do, and the weaver starves.
There were starving weavers in all the villages, and
some it seemed impossible to save even with the
food represented by a gift of twopence.</p>

<p>It was the same with the landless labourers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
worked under the ryots for wages. It was the same
with the village blind, the village idiots, and the
lepers. No one could afford to employ labour now
or to give alms. In one village a labourer had
scooped a little hole in the ground, and fitted a
plantain leaf neatly into it as a bowl for gifts. But
charity was as dry as the heavens, and no alms fell.
I saw the plantain leaf still vainly appealing, but the
man had died of hunger. In another village they
were carrying a body to the fire, and they laid the
poor, naked thing down for me to see. It was a
woman’s body, a labourer’s sister, shrivelled and
spiky with hunger, like the skeleton of a starved
cat found under the slates. In defence of her
brother, the labourer himself, I must say that he
was dying of hunger too.</p>

<p>The village houses in this part of Orissa, as in
most parts of India, are built of mud plastered on
to a bamboo framework, with wooden doorposts and
rafters. They are thatched with rice straw or palm
branches. At the first rush of the flood, the houses
dissolved like children’s castles in the tide, and I
saw flat and bare plots of land where they had stood.
Even the houses that had escaped the water were
almost as bare, for the people had been obliged to
sell the scanty stock of furniture that Hindu villagers
possess—brass pots and plates, a corn bin, cooking
vessels, and perhaps a bed—in order to pay the rent
which the zemindars or landlords continued to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
exact, though I was told the officials had ordered a
suspension.</p>

<p>The native official “tahsildars,” acting as
village tax-collectors, had also compelled them to
sell everything they had, even to their wooden doorposts,
as I said, for paying the “chaukidari” tax (or
“tikut,” as they call it) which supports the village
police. It is a small tax, paid quarterly, and running
from a halfpenny up to 1<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> a month per house,
but the police pay used formerly to be raised from
special plots of land set apart in each village for the
purpose, and the imposition of a hut-tax for the
purpose ten years ago had always been regarded as
a grievance. Nor does it matter whether a tax is
great or small when you have to sell the family
plate, valued at eighteenpence, to pay it. Just
before my journey through the country, this tax
had also been officially remitted, but it was collected
up to a day or two previously, and was always
mentioned by the people as one of their most irritating
grievances. No one loves a tax-collector, but
in time of famine there is something particularly
galling in selling one’s property to feed the police
for preserving it.</p>

<p>In Orissa itself and in Calcutta the British
officials were being rather angrily criticized for
negligence, but apart from the necessary failure of
a system which tries to administer welfare through
foreign rulers who live completely isolated from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
people, I do not think the officials were to blame.
They had given a little relief at first. When the
rains that ought to have fallen did not fall, they
gave a little more. They remitted a tax, and called
on the zemindars to remit rent. They did not
discourage a band of Indian volunteers, some of
whom belonged to a reforming Vedantic Order in
Calcutta, from distributing private relief. Sir
Andrew Fraser, Lieut.-Governor of Bengal, who
was then on progress through Orissa, and spent a
day in the famine district, told me relief works were
just going to be undertaken, and the Government
expected to spend about £20,000 on the business
of keeping alive and starting again. He probably
knew as much about starvation in the abstract as
any official could, for he was in control of the relief
in the Central Provinces during the terrible famine
of 1900.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The officials had also made the usual
advances, called “takavi” loans, to holders of two
to ten acres for the purchase of new seed and stock
upon the security of their holding.</p>

<p>On the whole, the violent personal attacks
upon the officials appeared to arise chiefly from the
habit of all peoples who are compelled to submit to
a fatherly despotism. Being themselves excluded
from a voice in their destiny, they turn savagely
upon the Government whenever distress or disorder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
supervenes, and the only real hope I could see in
the situation was the appearance of the little bands
of volunteers who in true Swadeshi spirit were
spreading the conception of self-reliance throughout
India. Sir Andrew Fraser and the higher officials
welcomed their efforts, but the average Anglo-Indians
and the journalists of Calcutta either treated
them with contempt, or shrieked “sedition!”</p>

<p>Whatever blame lay with the authorities seemed
to arise from the usual official tendency to make
light of distress for fear of increasing difficulties,
and to temper benevolence with bad manners. I
think both tendencies were interestingly combined
in a Bengali Deputy Magistrate, who was superintending
the relief in one of the larger villages. I
was myself travelling with Mr. Madhu Sudan Das,
a resident of Cuttack, highly educated on European
lines, the only Uriya graduate of Calcutta, and a
man well known throughout India for his unlimited
generosity and devotion to his own people,
whose rights he had often vindicated against aggression.
From early manhood he had been a Christian,
though perhaps not a very dogmatic and ecclesiastical
Christian, his faith being founded entirely
upon his heartfelt admiration of Christ’s prayer,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.” “The man who could utter that prayer
while dying under torture was divine,” he often
said to me. “The moment I heard the prayer, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
recognized that truth, and I have never doubted it
since.”</p>

<p>But Christian though he was, and though his
daughter had studied in Cambridge, and now lived
in Cuttack like an English lady without a shade of
“purdah,” he was almost worshipped as the saint
of Orissa by the poor among his countrymen. I
have seen a man with a frightful running sore
entreat Mr. Das to lend him the eighth of a penny
that he might touch the sore with it and be healed.
Another came with a brass bowl and implored Mr.
Das to dip his finger into the water that his wife
might be delivered from her dangerous labour, and
the moment he dipped his finger into the water,
the child was safely born.</p>

<p>Unhappily, in spite of his Christianity and
saintly reputation, Mr. Das appeared to act on
official minds much as a hedgehog would on a
naked man who found one rolled up in his bed.
On arriving one night at a dak-bungalow or rest-house,
we found that two of the three rooms were
occupied by a Bengali magistrate and a colleague.
So having arranged that Mr. Das, who was oldish
and invalid, should have the other room while I
slept in the free air like the elephant, we sent in our
names to the Deputy Magistrate and were invited to
enter. Knowing Mr. Das well by reputation, he had
evidently determined not to fall below the standard
of European dignity. Consequently he received us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
with his legs on the long arms of his deck-chair—an
attitude which, I suppose, he had observed
as customary among English officials when
they receive “natives,” and I could not correct his
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. Das began by requesting him to hear the
petitions of three or four widows who stood lamenting
outside the door because their husbands had
died of starvation. Entrenched behind his legs,
the official refused to comply, stating that he had
already heard their cases, and had proved to his
own satisfaction that the men had not died of
starvation, but of something else. Mr. Das then
went through a number of other cases, in most of
which the official said he thought he had made
examination, but could not be sure. Anyhow, all
charges of neglect or harshness against the officials
were absolutely false, and he was not there to be
cross-examined. With prickly insistence, Mr. Das
continued his interrogations upon the complaints
of the villagers, till at last the Deputy Magistrate,
irritated past human endurance, refused to say any
more, and waving good-night to his boots we left
the room.</p>

<p>On our return journey, a day or two later, we
discovered that he had sent out orders by the <em>chaukidars</em>
or village police to all the villages round,
commanding the people not to come out to meet
us under threats of unknown penalties. So great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
is the terror inspired by officials and police under
a bureaucracy, that very few came of the hundreds
who had before thronged our path in hopes of
winning some assistance, or merely of seeing the
elephant and their national favourite. The few who
did come told us the truth with fear, and perhaps
we should never have got at the real facts if we had
not found a chaukidar in one village actually going
round from house to house with the order. Yet
Mr. Das was a man whose assistance in such a
crisis any one but an official would have been
delighted to secure; for the people trusted him
absolutely, in spite of his foreign religion, and no
one living understood them better. It was only
that he was the kind of man who perturbs tabulated
columns.</p>

<p>Most administrators would find it much easier
to appreciate a Rajah or Tributary Chief who lived
about twenty miles from Cuttack, and expended, as
I was told, £335 on a breakfast which he expected
to offer the Lieutenant-Governor with the usual
trimmings of dancing-girls, fireworks, and other
delights. At such a breakfast cases of starvation
could hardly occur, and nothing would interrupt the
cheers, loyalty, and goodwill, such as Simla and the
Anglo-Indian papers were expecting from the proposed
Advisory Councils of Notables. Yet £335
did seem a largish sum to consume at one meal in
the midst of a starving people. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Lieutenant-Governor thought so too, for I believe
he continued his progress without accepting the
entertainment. One would like to know how that
meal was ever consumed. Perhaps the elephants
were called in to help.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">From every part of India, by day and night, the
pilgrims come, and the roads to the great temple, by
the sea at Puri, are always open and always thronged.
The pilgrims come from behind the white mountains,
and from the purple lands of the south, and
across the hot plains from the other ocean. The
train that shot me out upon the sand amid a crowd
of dim white figures at three o’clock one morning
raises a high dividend from religion. Hundreds
come by it every day, for it saves time—and under
British rule even devotion goes by time. But worshippers
still think it more religious and purifying
to make the whole journey on foot, visiting other
sacred temples upon the road, bathing in holy rivers,
and turning at every dawn towards the rising sun,
as all mankind instinctively turn for worship, just as
for love we turn towards the sunset. To take years
upon the journey only extends the glory of expectation,
and if you have the holy patience to travel the
Grand Trunk Road, measuring every two yards of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>its thousand miles by prostrating your body along
the dust, what is space, what is time, when you are
on the way to God?</p>

<p>Children and young mothers come if the entire
family sets out for holiness, but the best time for
the great act of worship is late in middle-age, when
for many years the field has been sown and reaped,
the buffalo fed, the taxes paid, the children tended,
the cotton garment daily washed. Then the present
career upon this visible world is almost over, the
shadowy gate to the next stage upward is almost in
sight. Then men and women long to go on pilgrimage,
and, untouched by the cares of fortune,
family, or any transitory things, they travel forth in
calm elation of soul, their thoughts fixed only on the
lasting realities of eternity, till they hear the thud of
the long waves upon the sand, and before them rises
the great white tower of the Lord of the Universe,
surmounted by its wheel and flag. There stands at
length the beatific vision, there the end of all these
labours, the revelation of the Divine Essence for
which they had waited so many years of repeated
seasons in the fields.</p>

<p>It is the ancient temple of Juggernath, “Lord of
the World,” to which they have come. Yes, our
old friend Juggernath, of childhood’s stories and
journalistic tags—the God in the Car, before whose
bloodstained wheels the benighted heathen were
driven by deceiving priests to fling themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
shrieking down, before the days when enlightened
missionaries and British rulers combined to clean up
India’s coral strand. Since then, as is well known,
such extremity of devotion has been prosecuted as
the law directs, and the guide-book tells us that
“of recent years much has been done to improve
the sanitation of the place.” Both signs of progress
are good. But, after all, it is only an Englishman
whose first thought is of sanitation when he
approaches the divine presence, and the British
missionaries who first told that weary old tale of
the car were as incapable of understanding the
divine passion that, even at the cost of life, yearns
for union with eternal powers, as they would have
been of understanding the passion of a woman
whose grandson described to me how, with proud
bearing and joyful face, she walked from her
chamber and sat down in the midst of the flames
beside her husband’s body till their ashes lay
indistinguishably commingled. Sanitary appliances
and the “Merry Widow” appeal more successfully
to our Western minds.</p>

<p>The fame of Juggernath may be due, as scholars
say, to some ancient attempt to conciliate under his
symbol the new Buddhistic reformers with the
primeval Hindu worship. It seems to be certain
that his temple as it stands shows the trace of
Buddhistic influence—the teaching of Buddha who
made the great renunciation, Buddha who received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the poor and all mankind beneath his blessing. It
is a shrine of peace and conciliation, perhaps the
one place in India where former generations saw
some hope of acquiring the new purity and kindliness
of life, without rejecting the sacred traditions of
immemorial wisdom brought by unknown ancestors
from lands of bitter cold. And it may have been
this bright hope of peace that first established the
unaltering rule of Juggernath’s worship, that before
his sight all castes and ranks and riches are equal,
and the woman is equal with the man.</p>

<p>Lions and monsters guard the four gates of his
enclosure, but when once they are passed, all the
earthly distinctions of mankind fall away, and only
the naked soul remains to worship. Within that
oblong wall, Brahman may eat with sweeper, and
warrior with the retail seller of flesh for carrion
Europeans. Along the inner side of the south wall
are simple kitchens, where the god’s four hundred
cooks daily prepare the sacred food for pilgrims,
beggars, and all who come. One is served with
another, and all may eat from the same dish, side by
side, without contamination. Thousands of monks
in the service of the god carry the food far through
the country, and the pilgrims themselves take some
of it home in their brazen vessels, so that the
villagers and children left behind may taste of
wisdom, and share the blessings of pilgrimage. For
wherever the sacred food is eaten, worldly differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
disappear, and soul stands bare to soul. It is the
sacrament of equality, the consecration of mankind.</p>

<p>Side by side with Juggernath, within the dark
and secluded shrine, upon which no alien may look,
stand his brother and little sister—quaint figures all
of them, hideous as gollywogs with symbolism—the
round and staring eyes of eternal vision, the
atrophied hands and feet of eternal meditation.
Every year new cars are built for them, and every
twelve years the gods themselves are made anew of
wooden blocks, while their old forms are sunk into
a pit to perish. This was told me by the treasurer
and chief trustee of the god’s vast estate, who traced
to this renewal the well-known story of the physicians
appointed to minister to the deity’s health, and put
him to bed if he ails. He informed me this was a
popular error, but there is a Rajah who is hereditary
guardian, and also hereditary sweeper of the temple,
and he, as I understood, had rather frequently to be
put to bed by his physicians, so that possibly the
two cases have become confused.</p>

<p>It would be, perhaps, too curious to identify the
little sister of Juggernath with Liberty, and his
brother with Fraternity. But Juggernath, “Lord of
the World,” has beyond question the attribute of
Equality, and it seems possible that it is just this
glorious attribute, and no deeper metaphysic reason,
which gives his temple its place as the most worshipped
fane of India, and inspires the common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
people with a passionate desire even to touch with
one finger the painted board of which he is made.
Many people worship what most they fall short of,
just as in England we struggle to worship Christ,
whose character and manner of life differed so
entirely from our own. And of all great virtues
the Indians, perhaps, have been most wanting in the
sense of equality. Their whole system of existence
is based on inequality, inevitable and permanent.
The man who is born to study the Vedas will continue
to study the Vedas, and so will his son. The
man who is born to carry sewage will continue to
carry sewage, and so will his son. Nor could the
daughter of a millionaire ever hope for marriage with
a man of learning, since wisdom lies beyond the
dreams of avarice.</p>

<p>This ancient basis of inequality has made the
Indian people the easiest in the world to govern. It
lies also, I think, at the bottom of their almost excessive
politeness, their reverential manners, their courtly
deference to any one who appears to have been born
of higher station, or with higher advantages. No
one denies the charm of such qualities. It is an
education in behaviour to pass from a Scottish or
American crowd to the streets of an Indian city.
The obligations of high caste—such things, I mean,
as cleanliness in food and life, intellectual alertness,
and disregard of wealth—are as valuable as any obligations
laid on Europeans by noblesse. The only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
weakness about both is that they are restricted to
caste or class, and are not considered universally
binding, as such principles must be.</p>

<p>There is much to be said for reverential manners;
but take a race which has very little notion of manners
of any kind—a race not very sensitive, not very
imaginative or sympathetic, trained from boyhood to
think little of personal dignity, and nothing at all of
other people’s feelings; take such a race and set its
most characteristic members from the well-to-do
middle classes, with the help of rifles and batteries, to
dominate an entirely different people, among whom
reverential manners are ingrained by birth, and see
what evil effects for both races will result! Watch
the growing arrogance of the dominant people;
watch their demands for deference, their lust for
flattery, their irritation at the least sign of independence,
their contempt for the race whose obeisance
they delight in, their rudeness of manner increasing
till it becomes incredible to the relatives
they left at home, and would once have been incredible
to themselves. Then turn to the subordinate
race, and watch the growing weakness of character,
the temptation to cringe and flatter, the loss of self-respect,
the increasing cowardice, the daily humiliation.
In that hideous process—that degeneration in
manners of two great races, each of which has high
qualities of its own, we recognize the true peril which
has been advancing upon Indians and ourselves for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the last ten, or, perhaps, fifty years of Indian history.
It is not a question of loss of power, or loss of trade.
It is a question of a much more serious loss than
these.</p>

<p>But what if all this so-called unrest is only
the beginning of another great humanistic reform,
another incarnation of that “Lord of the World”
whose attribute is equality? Throughout India we
are witnessing the birth of a new national consciousness,
and with it comes a revival of dignity, a resolve
no longer to take insults lying down, not to lick the
hand that strikes, or rub the forehead in the dust
before any human being, simply because he wears a
helmet and is called white. Like pilgrims bound for
the shrine of Juggernath in an ecstasy of devotion,
the leaders of India are inspired by that longing for
equality which is always springing afresh in human
minds. If any one chooses to say that equality is
like Juggernath’s Car, crushing everything equally
flat, he is welcome to his little jest. But as I saw the
white-robed pilgrims passing into the temple, there
to partake of equality’s sacrament, I knew that these
outward things were but the symbols of an invisible
worship, which may renew the face of the Indian
people, and save ourselves from a threatening and
dishonourable danger.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">The plains of Eastern Bengal have been formed
grain by grain from the washings of the dividing
range of Asia brought down by melted snow on
its way to the sea. Rivers that rise not very far
apart on opposite sides of the Himalaya here unite
at last after their thousand miles of circuit, and
finish their course by broad and quiet streams,
which lose the sacred names of Ganges and Brahmaputra.
Some of the rivers also spring from the hill-country
of Assam and the ranges where the pleasant
station of Shillong offers a summer residence for the
new Lieut.-Governor of Eastern Bengal as comfortably
isolated from his capital at Dacca, as Simla or
Darjeeling is from Calcutta. Thus the whole
country is intersected with vast waterways and
streams as slow and curling as the Ouse. Railways
are built only in short sections, as it were to connect
the rivers, and continuous roads must be
very few. Everything goes by water, and the
only trouble is that the rivers sometimes change
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>their course, owing to an earthquake or other
natural caprice. Their channels, too, are continually
silting up, so that the course of the steamers upon
their broad surface is always a little dubious, and,
in spite of its slip of railway, the new capital of
Dacca is even now being cut off from the world.</p>

<p>But for the square-sailed junks that the Indians
use, and for the long black boats with pointed prow
and stern pitched high in air, the rivers form a fine
system of traffic; and if the water takes a fancy for
a new passage through miles of cultivated land the
owners of the fields simply stake out their claims
upon the surface, confident that in God’s good
time the river will withdraw, leaving the soil to
future generations only the richer for its deposit.
The whole country is, indeed, one of the richest
parts of India, and the rivers pass between flat
lands of mangoes and palm trees, jute or yellow
rice. At times the size and stillness of the streams
reminded me of the Oil Rivers of Southern Nigeria;
but how different here are the firm and fruitful banks
from those gloomy creeks and forests of the slime!
When they are not busy in their sunny fields, the
people are chiefly engaged in washing themselves,
their babies, and their brazen vessels. Large numbers
are also occupied in fishing, especially for a
bony fish like a gigantic perch, which they drive
into the nets with tame otters, captive in long
leashes. Others live by converting the clay of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
banks into enormous potting jars that serve as
stores for grain, <em>ghee</em> (clarified butter), and other
food. The waterways also still carry a certain
amount of the country’s ancient industries—the
gold and silver work, the bangles and ornaments
cut from white conchs, and, above all, the hand-woven
muslins for which Dacca was once celebrated
throughout the world.</p>

<p>Since England killed the Indian cotton industry
for the benefit of Lancashire, first by imposing duties
on imports from India, and then by the present
excise of 3½ per cent. upon Indian cottons manufactured
for India itself, that ancient fame is chiefly
found in museum specimens of past splendour, and
in lingering words like the French “Indienne” for
calico print. Even in Dacca the very finest muslin,
such as the cows used to lick up with the grass,
feeling no difference between it and gossamer, is
no longer made. It has fallen out, partly owing
to Manchester, partly because there are no longer
enough rich Indians to buy it. But still the great
caste of weavers have clung to their hand-looms as
fondly as starving ryots cling to the land. There
is hardly any difference of race in Bengal, but it
so happens that nearly all the weavers are Mohammedans,
descended from the old Hindu families
who changed their religion to please their conquerors
in the days when Dacca itself was an Islam capital
of empire. In the last three years, the Swadeshi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
movement, which officials have told Lord Morley is
specially abhorrent to Mohammedans, has enormously
increased their industry. It has revived the ancient
craft just as it was dying, and so I found the weavers
in every town and village sitting on the floor, with
legs stuck under the wooden loom, plying their
thin-spun thread with hereditary skill—plying it
sometimes under water, so that a woman’s skin
should hardly feel a stuff so fine and soft.</p>

<p>But one can never be sure how long a handicraft,
no matter how beautiful, can hold its own against
the mills. Even under Swadeshi the hand-looms
will probably disappear, and the main produce of
Eastern Bengal is no longer the most delicate fabric
in the world, but the roughest. It is jute. It is
not literally true that this dark and fibrous plant,
something between a mallow and a flax, grows only
in East Bengal, but it grows best there, and almost
all that is used in the jute factories of Dundee is
imported from this land of rivers. I believe it was
through the Dundee shippers, not more than one
generation ago, that jute first came to the Tay, but
since then the prosperity of the jute wives on the
Tay has varied with the prosperity of the peasant
wives on the Ganges, and, unhappily, it has often
varied inversely.</p>

<p>It is very doubtful whether the immense
increase of the jute crop has been of real benefit to
the peasant. The price is variable. In 1906, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
example, it went up to 14<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a maund (82 lbs.),
and all the peasants laid down their land in jute,
thus creating such a scarcity of rice that its price
went up more than double—from an average of
5<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> to 12<em>s.</em> a maund. In some districts rice rose
to more than three times its normal price. Drought
and flood combined to increase the scarcity, and a
terrible famine ensued. Of course, it ought not to
have been so. Economists would say that the sale
of the jute and the export of the rice should bring
in money with which the peasants could purchase
food. The trouble was that reality refused to
support the economic doctrine.</p>

<p>Jute, like flax, is a very exhausting crop, yet I
have seen it actually planted on the same field with
rice, and at the same time, because it grows quicker,
and can be harvested while the rice is green and
short. Nothing but a deluge can restore the soil so
treated, and, at the best, jute wants more room
and more labour. Then there are the middlemen
to be considered—the British and Jewish middlemen
who swarm at the centres of the jute trade,
where the heavy wooden junks lie thick as a town
upon the rivers. Lastly, there is the zemindar or
landowner. He comes under the Permanent Settlement
of Bengal, and his rent or tax to Government
is fixed for ever. But within limits he can raise the
rent on the cultivator, and it is in the nature of
landlords to raise the rent. They are not rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
themselves, these zemindars. Throughout Bengal I
heard lamentable stories of their genteel but increasing
poverty that reminded me of the distressed Irish
landlords of twenty years ago. Like the French,
they have the custom of dividing the land equally
among the children, and the Mohammedans endow
their daughters in the division, which is very nice
of them, but only hastens the family ruin. Unless
a zemindar family launches out into other forms
of labour beyond eating its rents, the number of
hangers-on to small parcels of land increases, and
their condition is often pitiable. All the more
because, though the Settlement is permanent, the
cesses or rates nominally levied for roads and District
Boards, but really applied to all manner of other
purposes, are continually increasing, and the curse
of malaria, which saps the vitality and rots the brain,
appears to be falling with peculiar virulence upon
the zemindar class.</p>

<p>It is a question whether jute and the export of
rice have benefited any one except the merchants
and middlemen. Owing to the fall in jute, the
peasants were growing quantities of rice again when
I was there; but next year the rice might go down
and jute up, and so they live in a gambler’s uncertainty,
and lay up no store of food, as the custom
used to be, against the evil day. They sell everything
as it grows, and with the money buy Rangoon
rice which makes them sick. Many paternal officials,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
though bred on our university economics, told me
that to save the people they would even prohibit
jute, tax exported rice, and abolish the cotton excise.</p>

<p>So far we may say the contest lies between
Dundee and Eastern Bengal, but though I believe it
to be a vital matter, that contest is tranquil and slow
compared to the dramatic battle raging between
Eastern Bengal and the British cities of Liverpool
and Manchester. Liverpool stands for salt, Manchester
for cotton, and Eastern Bengal has taken a
solemn vow not to touch either their salt or their
cotton till the burning wrong of Bengal is redressed.
By the burning wrong they mean the Partition of
the Bengali people into two separate and unconnected
governments, Bengal proper to contain
18,000,000 of the race, and Eastern Bengal to contain
25,000,000. With the addition of the outlying
and alien provinces of Behar, Chota Nagpur, and
Orissa, Lord Curzon estimated the population of
Bengal under the old capital of Calcutta at
54,000,000, of whom 9,000,000 would be Mohammedans;
while, including the outlying and alien
province of Assam, the population of “Eastern
Bengal and Assam” with a new capital at Dacca
would come to 31,000,000, of whom 18,000,000
would be Mohammedans. Throughout the whole
of Bengal, whether East or West, it must be again
remembered that the people are homogeneous, both
Mohammedans and Hindus belonging to the Bengali<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
race, speaking the same language, living in amity
side by side for generations past, and only divided
in religion because some of their number, chiefly of
the lower and less educated castes, had long ago
embraced Islam for the most persuasive of reasons.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Various schemes for sharing out the administrative
burden of the vast province with its dependencies
had been discussed for at least twelve years
before, and there were obvious ways in which it
could have been done—by creating the three contiguous
districts of different race into a new western
province with the capital at Patna, or by placing
them under Chief Commissioners, while in either
case Bengal should be raised to a Presidency under
a Governor in Calcutta, enjoying the same privileges
as Madras and Bombay. By the Charter of 1833
we promised a Governorship for Fort William
(Calcutta), and the promise was renewed by Lord
Dalhousie in 1853. It is hard in England to understand
the difference that Indians feel between a
Lieutenant-Governor trained in Anglo-Indian routine
and a Governor appointed from among the leading
men of England, and coming to their country free
from the narrowing routine of the Service and Anglo-Indian
society. But a very short time in India
shows what that difference means.</p>

<p>Far from carrying out these pledges or following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
a smaller scheme of devolution favoured by Mr.
Brodrick (Lord Midleton), at that time Secretary of
State for India, Lord Curzon determined to split the
Bengali people roughly in half and give them two
Lieutenant-Governors instead of one—with a view,
of course, to “greater administrative efficiency”;
for, as Mr. John Morley somewhere remarked,
“the usual excuse of those who do evil to other
people is that their object is to do them good.” The
first sign of Lord Curzon’s purpose was Sir Herbert
Risley’s letter of December 3, 1903, announcing a
Partition in the name of the Government of India.
The scheme then proposed was instantly met by
a storm of opposition throughout Bengal, among
Mohammedans and Hindus alike, and to the credit
of Anglo-Indians it must be said that the opposition
of the Bengalis was supported by many of the
officials and by the leading Anglo-Indian newspapers,
though the worldly success of officials and
newspapers largely depends on Government favour.</p>

<p>Always impatient of criticism, Lord Curzon
hastened through Eastern Bengal, lecturing the
Hindu leaders and trying to win over the Moslems.
With the Moslems, by one means or another, he
partially succeeded, but the opposition among the
bulk of the Bengal population continued as determined
as ever. Hundreds of indignation meetings
were held; I believe about two thousand in all.
Great petitions were presented; one with 70,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
signatures attached was sent to the Home Government.
But it was all in vain. The English people
paid no attention; they were not sure where Bengal
was; most of them had never heard of it apart from
tigers, and did not care what Partition meant. The
Home Government perhaps had its own reasons for
“letting Curzon down gently.” The scheme was
hustled through almost in secrecy, and almost
avowedly against his better judgment, Mr. Brodrick
gave his assent. The fatal “Government Resolution
on the Partition of Bengal” was issued from
Simla on July 19, 1905; it was followed by the
Proclamation of September 1st, and a blow was
given to the credit of our country and to her reputation
for justice and popular government, from
which it will take us long years of upright administration
and reform to recover.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>On October 16th of the same year the Resolution
took effect, and the Partition became what Mr.
Morley in an unhappy moment called “a settled
fact.” The anniversary of that national wrong has
now become the Ash Wednesday of India. On
that day thousands and thousands of Indians rub
dust or ashes on their foreheads; at dawn they
bathe in silence as at a sacred fast; no meals are
eaten; the shops in cities and the village bazaars
are shut; women refuse to cook; they lay aside
their ornaments; men bind each other’s wrists with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
a yellow string as a sign that they will never forget
the shame; and the whole day is passed in resentment,
mourning, and the hunger of humiliation.
In Calcutta vast meetings are held, and the errors
of the Indian Government are exposed with eloquent
patriotism. With each year the indignation of the
protest has increased; the crowds have grown
bigger, the ceremonial more widely spread, the fast
more rigorous.</p>

<p>Such was the Partition of Bengal, prompted,
as nearly all educated Indians believe, by Lord
Curzon’s personal dislike of the Bengali race, as
shown also by his Convocation speech of the
previous February, in which he brought against
the whole people an indictment for mendacity.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The Partition marks the beginning of the “unrest”
in its present form. I think some kind of unrest
would have been developed within the next few
years in any case. It arises from all manner of
deep-lying causes—from the success of Asiatic
Japanese in war against a great European power,
from the general communication by railway, the
visits of even high-caste Brahmans to Europe, the
use of English as a common tongue, the increasing
knowledge of our history and liberties, and the
increasing study of our great Liberal thinkers
and John Morley’s works. Add to these things
the growing alienation of the subject races, owing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
to notorious cases of injustice in the law courts,
ill-mannered arrogance on the part of certain
Anglo-Indians, abusive incitements to violence by
Anglo-Indian newspapers, and a system of espionage
by the police and postal officials. It would be a
wonder indeed if any people with a grain of self-respect
left in them had remained unmoved. But
beyond question it was the Partition that directly
occasioned the present outbreaks of distrust and
hostility. When their petitions remained unanswered,
and their public meetings had no effect,
when the Partition was carried out with despotic
indifference to their feelings and interests, the
Bengali people, and through them the vast majority
of educated Indians, unwillingly became convinced
that England no longer cared what happened to
them or their country, provided they paid the
revenue and kept quiet. It was a dangerous conviction
to which they had been brought. England
as a whole neither knew nor cared anything about
it. She thought she had done enough when she
had entrusted Lord Curzon and the Home Government
with the duty of knowing and caring.</p>

<p>All advocates of the Partition, from Sir Harvey
Adamson downwards, have continually sneered at
the Bengali objection to having their country cut in
half as “sentimental.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> By “sentimental” I find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
that this sort of people always understand an emotion
that does not bring in sixpence. For instance, if we
love our country because of her reputation for justice
and freedom, they call us hysterical sentimentalists;
but if we love our country because trade follows the
flag, they call us sound supporters of the Empire.
In accordance with this despicable standard, we may
say that the chief objection to the Partition is one
of sentiment. It is none the less strong on that
account. It is the same kind of sentiment as would
set Scotland ablaze with indignation if an English
Prime Minister drew a jagged line from Thurso to
Dumfries, and announced that in future Scotland
would consist of two separate provinces, with one
government in Edinburgh and the other in Glasgow,
and no connection between them. A Scotsman’s
chief objection might be described as “sentimental”
by people of Sir Harvey Adamson’s mind, but I
think “unrest” would hardly be the word for what
would follow.</p>

<p>Yet that is exactly what England has allowed to
be done in Bengal. The root of the indignation is
a sentiment—an emotion that does not bring in sixpence.
It is the sentiment of a patriotic and progressive
race cut in two by an action which they
believe to have been arbitrary and suggested by
pique. And just because it is a sentiment, no
material advantage or convenience of administration
can ever serve as compensation for the wrong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
But even if outraged national feeling could be
set aside as a sentimental complaint, the other
grievances are strong. Calcutta is justly claimed
by all Bengalis for their own capital, as well as
the capital of India. It is the centre of their culture
and trade, of justice and government. It has
the best Indian newspapers; it is the home of
the best social intercourse; its University sets the
standard of knowledge; its High Court is regarded
with confidence by all Indians as a sure appeal against
injustice. To be separated from Calcutta and compelled
to look to poor, ruinous, decrepit old Dacca
as their capital is for Bengalis an intellectual and
material loss. Dacca was a good enough Mohammedan
capital three centuries ago, but now it is difficult
to get at; its river, as I said, is silting up; it has not
a single newspaper worthy of the name; it has no
University, no High Court, and its new Lieutenant-Governor
lives for months together far away at
Shillong, almost inaccessible in the hills. It is true
that Government has bought a lot of land north of
the town and has laid out foundations for residences
and offices where future officials can enjoy themselves
in comfort. The existence of those foundations
is a common argument against reversing the
Partition even among the many officials who recognized
its error. But to the Bengalis it only makes
the thing worse, for their wretched country will now
have to pay fora double set of buildings, a double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
set of high and low officials, and a double set of
questionable police.</p>

<p>There are other points. No one but landlords
feels much disturbed at the woes of landlords, who
suck their livelihood off the land like ticks off a sheep.
But even sheep-ticks have their feelings, and in
Eastern Bengal the zemindars also have a certain
use in the world, especially when hunger drives
them to cultivate their land themselves. To the
zemindars the Partition has been a loss and hardship,
increasing their legal expenses, and reducing
such amenity as life afforded them. Naturally, their
sufferings are worst when the line of partition passes
straight through their land and exposes their flanks
to double lawyers’ fees from right and left. An
Englishman whose ancestral estate had been thus
divided between the two provinces, told me his
existence had been rendered almost intolerable. He
had always been accustomed to go to Calcutta for
business connected with the estate, and as he was a
celebrated polo-player and took an intelligent interest
in horse-racing, his business visits to the capital were
both frequent and pleasing. But now for more than
half his business he had to travel far away to dingy
Dacca—no horse-racing; no polo renown! This
was no imaginary or sentimental grievance like the
indignation of a proud and ancient race split in two
for the satisfaction of its rulers, and I felt sure that
if only such a case could be brought home to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
sportsmanlike governors of our Empire, they would
persuade Lord Morley to regard his “settled fact”
in a more pliable spirit.</p>

<p>The Eastern Bengalis also object to being bound
up with the backward province of Assam, whose
people they regard as semi-barbarous, and for whose
improvement they alone will now have to pay,
whereas the cost was formerly shared by all India.
“Are we to be Assamese for ever?” is the scornful
question of even Mohammedan peasants when they
meet the sort of man who knows the news. Equally
significant was a small Assamese deputation which
came to me in Calcutta, because they had heard I
was a Liberal, and they supposed that a Liberal
Government would listen to Liberal principles.
Their petition was for help in removing the yoke
which now binds them to Eastern Bengal, where
the progressive and educated population are too
clever for them by half!</p>

<p>But of all material grievances—of all grievances
other than the central crime of cutting a nationality
in half—I think the Eastern Bengalis most fear
their threatened separation from the Calcutta High
Court. It is true that the blow has not yet fallen,
but it is almost certain to fall, and the Government
has refused to give any pledge against it. When
I consulted Sir Andrew Fraser, the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal, upon this subject, he very
kindly referred me to Sir Herbert Risley’s answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, which had
from the first petitioned against the change.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In
Sir Andrew Fraser’s opinion, “Lord Curzon’s
Government there placed clearly on record their
view that nothing less than a High Court could
ever be established in the new province,” but he
appears to me to have misread the document. In
the main sections of his reply, Sir Herbert Risley
carefully guards the Government three times over
from making any guarantee as to the future. He
states it as the Government’s opinion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“That it is most unlikely that in the event of the
existing judicial machinery being found inadequate for the
service of the two provinces and of public opinion then
demanding the establishment of a Chartered High Court,
any tribunal occupying a position of less authority and
influence would either be proposed by the Government of
India or sanctioned by the Secretary of State.”</p>
</div>

<p>But he refuses to bind the future Government
either to maintain the present connection between
Eastern Bengal and the Calcutta High Court, or to
establish a new High Court at Dacca in its place.
The fear of the Eastern Bengalis is that in place of
a High Court, which is regarded throughout India
as the embodiment of true British justice uncontaminated
by Anglo-Indian prejudice and tradition,
they may be put off with a Chief Court, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the judges have been trained under the distorting
influence of that prejudice and tradition. It is hard
for us, accustomed to regard all our Courts as fairly
equal in the dispensation of justice, to realize what
that difference implies to Indians. But it is exactly
parallel to the difference they recognize between
most Anglo-Indians and the Englishman straight
from home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="smcap fs80">Swadeshi and the Volunteers</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Partition led to Swadeshi. Of course, there
was nothing new in an attempt to encourage Indian
industries. For thirty years past the true friends of
India, like Sir William Wedderburn, had been
insisting that the solution of her economic miseries
lay partly in diverting some portion of her agricultural
population to the industrial work for which
she used to be celebrated till England stamped on
her manufactures and determined to use her only as
a farm for raw material and a market for Lancashire.
Artistic people had also attempted to realize the
same object, for it did not require a politician’s eye
to perceive the immense superiority of Indian fabrics
in point of beauty. But the true Swadeshi movement
dates from the year of the Partition. I believe
it was first suggested by Mr. Krishna Kumar Mitra
in his paper <cite>Sanjibani</cite>, when he declared that
India’s one sure means of drawing England’s attention
to the Partition and other wrongs was the
boycott of British goods. The movement, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
did not become public till a great meeting held in
Calcutta Town Hall on August 7, 1905, to protest
against the Partition. A form of oath was then
drawn up by Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, Principal
of Ripon College, Editor of the <cite>Bengali</cite>, and probably
the most prominent leader of the Congress party in
Bengal, and the oath ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“I hereby pledge myself to abstain from the purchase
of all English-made goods for at least a year from this date.
So help me God.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus a movement which had been entirely
economic for some twenty years suddenly became
political, and the boycott was added to Swadeshi.
The growth of the new phase was rapid. It spread
like a gospel through both provinces of Bengal.
Within a few months the reports of our Commissioners
were full of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The Swadeshi movement has contributed largely to
the development of the cotton cloth industry in all the
districts of this division,” writes the Commissioner of
Burdwan in Western Bengal (1906-7), “except Bankura,
where the inclination of the people to use country-made
things is not pronounced and consequently the sale of
Manchester goods has not much decreased.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the <cite>Indian Trade Journal</cite> (July 25, 1907),
published by the Government, the Magistrate of
Hooghly is quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It appears that while formerly the weavers had to take
advances from the middlemen, they are now very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
better off, and, if anything, the middlemen are sometimes
indebted to them.... There cannot be any doubt that,
on account of the Swadeshi movement, the weavers as a
class, who are a stay-at-home people, have distinctly
advanced. Fly-shuttle looms arc being largely used, and
the people are said to appreciate them.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the Report on the Land Revenue Administration
of the Lower Provinces (1906-7) we read—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is reported that on account of the demand for country-made
cloths, weavers working with the fly-shuttle can make
as much as Rs 20 (£1 6<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>) a month” (about double the
average earnings of the class) “and that the demand for their
services is daily increasing ... some prospect of improvement
in their material condition is held out by the present
Swadeshi movement, in so far as it may induce the younger
generation to devote themselves to a technical rather than a
literary profession.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the “Report on the Administration of Eastern
Bengal, 1905-6,” we find that eleven factories had
been added in the year to the seventy-one already
existing, the foreign imports showed a decrease of
16 per cent., and “Liverpool” salt had declined by
6000 tons. It has been the same with “imported
liquors,” though apparently the great decrease in
them does not mean a decline in drinking, but an
increase in “country” or Swadeshi spirits. The
Collector of Dacca, a strong opponent of Swadeshi,
or at all events of the boycott, remarked in his
Report for 1906-7—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Even the public women of Dacca and Narainganj took
the so-called Swadeshi vow and joined the general movement
against the use of foreign articles. People formerly
addicted to imported liquor took to country spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such facts prove how widely the movement
prevails among the common people. It is necessarily
a woman’s movement, because women wear
most of the cotton and do most of the housekeeping.
They are the thrifty sex, because they and the
children are generally the first to suffer from want.
If they sacrifice cheapness to political conviction, it
shows the conviction is strong; and though now the
coarse hand-woven <em>sari</em> or woman’s garment of the
greater part of India (at two to three shillings a pair)
is almost as cheap as Manchester stuff, and much
more durable, the sacrifice has been something. I
will add only two further proofs of the movement’s
strength. In reviewing the English exports in
cotton piece-goods for May, 1907, the <cite>Times</cite> remarked:
“India took less by 42,492,500 yards;”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and sitting by her mother, a child of Eastern Bengal
was heard to ask, “Mother, is this an English or
a Swadeshi mosquito?” “Swadeshi,” the mother
answered. “Then I won’t kill it,” said the
child.</p>

<p>Such was the movement which I had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
speeding up the eighty or ninety cotton mills in
Bombay, because, work as they might, they could
not keep pace with the demand from Bengal. It
is true that English manufacturers were said to be
adopting the simple device of stamping their Manchester
stuff with the Swadeshi mark, but I did not
discover how far their deceit was successful.</p>

<p>The movement was spreading to all kinds of
merchandise besides cotton. In Calcutta they had
started a Swadeshi match-factory, in Dacca soap-works
and tanneries. In all Indian towns you will now
find Swadeshi shops where you may buy native
biscuits, cigarettes, scents, toys, woollens, boots, and
all manner of things formerly imported. Nearly
all the trade advertisements in Indian papers are
now Swadeshi. The officials whom I consulted,
from the Governor of Bombay and the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal downwards, professed sympathy
and admiration for the Swadeshi movement.
It would be almost impossible for them to do
anything else, considering the economic salvation
it may bring to India if it is maintained. Their
interest in this economic development is quite
genuine, and I am told that, though under official
management, the Swadeshi stalls from Eastern Bengal
during the Calcutta Congress of 1906 were the
success of the exhibition. But the officials are in
a very difficult position. With all their love for
India, they do not like to stand by and see British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
trade ruined, neither does the word “boycott”
delight the official mind.</p>

<p>The Indians themselves have made an attempt
to separate Swadeshi from boycott, and again to
separate the economic boycott from the political
boycott. At the Calcutta Congress (December,
1906) two resolutions were adopted that were to
have a critical influence on the stormy Congress in
Surat a year later. They ran—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“(1) Having regard to the fact that the people of this
country have little or no voice in the administration and
that their representations to the Government do not receive
due consideration, this Congress is of opinion that the boycott
movement inaugurated in Bengal by way of protest against
the Partition of that province was and is legitimate.</p>

<p>“(2) This Congress accords its most cordial support to the
Swadeshi movement and calls upon the people of the country
to labour for its success by making earnest and sustained
efforts to promote the growth of indigenous industries and
to stimulate the production of indigenous articles by giving
them preference over imported commodities, even at some
sacrifice.”</p>
</div>

<p>The first resolution sanctioned the political boycott,
and was passed after much controversy, and
mainly to avoid an open rupture under the presidency
of the veteran Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji; for,
unless the resolution had been admitted, the Extremists
would have left the Congress. The second
resolution was for the encouragement of economic
Swadeshi, and was accepted almost without question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>It appears very doubtful whether the Swadeshi
movement could have been carried on without a
boycott of foreign goods; and as to political boycott,
the Swadeshi remained an impotent and
æsthetic concern till the political movement gave it
driving power. Swadeshi is now so strong that it
would probably hold its own even if all political
grievances were removed. But its true origin was
political, and hitherto it has been impossible to
separate it from its political motive—the protest
against the Partition of Bengal.</p>

<p>In any case, it was the political motive which
spread the Swadeshi vow like a beacon light through
Eastern Bengal. In towns and villages young men
formed themselves into associations to preach Swadeshi
and the boycott. Shops that continued the
sale of foreign goods were surrounded by youths
who implored customers for the sake of their
country to depart without purchasing. Boys threw
themselves prostrate in supplication before the customer’s
feet. This form of picketing was never
violent, and I think it was not often prosecuted. It
is true the officials regarded it with disfavour, and
at Barisal Sir Bampfylde Fuller personally compelled
the leading men of the town to withdraw a Swadeshi
appeal they were issuing to the villages (November
16, 1905), and through the District Magistrate and
Police he broke up a Provincial Conference which
was being held in the same town (April 15, 1906).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
But in some places the boycott took the form of
destroying British goods, especially “Liverpool
salt,” and the goods were not always paid for first,
though usually they were. In one case, four youths
destroyed foreign sugar, valued at is 1<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em>, and were
sentenced to three and four months’ imprisonment,
with heavy fines. As is usual when political offences
are savagely punished, the victims triumphed as
heroes in the popular mind.</p>

<p>But when I was in Eastern Bengal, the time for
that kind of boycott had passed. Even the remotest
villages knew the principle of Swadeshi then, and
the chief importance of the preaching movement
among the young men was the stimulus it gave
to the so-called “Volunteers.” In the previous
summer (1907), the phrase “National Volunteers”
had roused alarm among sensationalists at home;
but it was unknown in Eastern Bengal, and I
believe it to have been the sole invention of a
correspondent in Calcutta, who had at that time
set himself to make the flesh of the British public
creep. The Volunteers were originally organized
in the ’eighties to act as stewards at the National
Indian Congress, but under the enthusiasm of the
Swadeshi and national movement, they have developed
along many other lines. I met them first
in Orissa, relieving the distress from famine and
flood there, though Eastern Bengal was still their
proper sphere. In Barisal, the centre of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Bakerganj district, which was then the only part of
India proclaimed under the Seditious Meetings Act,
I first met one of the “captains,” a mere boy, who
explained to me the peculiar mixture of politics and
philanthropy in their duties. In the Barisal Braja
Mohun Institution, whose Principal, Mr. Aswini
Kumar Dutt, is a notable Nationalist, the students
had formed a society of Volunteers called “The
Little Brothers of the Poor,” for nursing among the
villages, especially in the commonest and most
deadly plagues of cholera and small-pox. The
Oxford Brethren, who have a strong settlement in
that unruly place and, I think, the only beautiful
Anglican church in India, spoke of the movement
as not unworthy of its famous name, though they
themselves refused to take any part in the political
controversies around them.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>But the work of the Volunteers is not chiefly
a matter of nursing and poor relief. In Calcutta
and other cities they arrange public meetings and
organize the course of the immense pilgrimages.
At fairs and the great festivals when Hindu women
come from all over the country to bathe in the
sacred rivers, they act as their protectors against
the rowdy class of Mohammedans, who regard
women as their natural prey. When the Mohammedans,
after the Partition, were induced to believe
that the Government would connive at any violence
on their part against the Hindu inhabitants, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>Volunteers attempted a defence of their homes and
temples. They were generally beaten, but they
are doing their best to stiffen their courage and
the fighting qualities we all admire. Ever since
Macaulay’s time the Anglo-Indians have wasted
much of their lives in sneering at Indians, and
especially at Bengalis, for effeminacy and unwarlike
habit. By athletics, gymnastics, by football with
bare feet, and lathi-play with the bamboo singlestick,
the Volunteers are now seeking to wipe off
the disgrace, and Anglo-Indians suspect sedition.
They cannot have it both ways, and, for myself, I
admire the Indian determination to obtain bodily
strength. For, without being advocates of war at
any price, we all know what moral force an
argument gains when we feel that, if sweet reasonableness
fails, we could, if we liked, knock the
adversary down and break his bones!</p>

<p>Of course, some one has to pay for Swadeshi,
and it is not always the British merchant who suffers
for Lord Curzon’s error. Late one night, as I sat
on a river steamer after two crowded days in a
strongly Swadeshi town, five or six dark forms
were dimly seen to gather round me with gestures
of secrecy and peril. In other countries I should
have thought them assassins thirsting for blood, but
they were only Hindu merchants with an interest in
Manchester piece-goods. Of these they had a large
store, I have forgotten how many thousand pounds’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
worth, laid up in their warehouses; and, in consequence,
they were shunned by their kind. Barbers
would not shave them, milkmen would not bring
them milk, friends would not come to their
daughters’ marriages, acquaintances would not say
good-morning. Such treatment was distressing and
inconvenient. Would I please use my influence
with the Home Government, and set everything
right again? They refused to throw in their lot
with the Swadeshi movement; their goods were
too valuable to be sacrificed, and they preferred to
stand and die as martyrs in the cause of British
commerce. I had no doubt their statement was
true, but what hope could I hold out to them?—I,
who had no influence with the Home Government,
and, if I had been an Indian, would have done my
utmost to dissuade my countrymen from buying
any foreign goods at all till grievances had been
redressed.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Dacca still wears something of a Mohammedan air,
for Akbar’s long arm reached to Eastern Bengal,
and the inheritors of his empire here built a fort,
a palace, and a capital. Passing one day among its
enclosed gardens, mouldering lengths of wall, and
dying mosques, I had begun to imagine myself back
in some Turkish town like Ochrida or Monastir,
when I was suddenly recalled to the streams of
Brahmaputra by the appearance of a large wooden
cage under a tree in an open court. It was bigger
than the cages in which Louis XI. swung his
political opponents in the castles of Touraine. It
would have held a bull as well as an eagle, and was
firmly set upon a base of stone, daubed with vermillion,
as is the Hindu way. Life in a cage has
always seemed to me so curious a choice when this
nutshell of a planet is itself so small, that I stopped
to contemplate it, and, observing my interest, the
Brahman who accompanied me began to knock with
a stone upon a large wooden box, which occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
one corner of the interior. The summons appeared
to be recognized, like the call to a menagerie’s wild
beast at feeding time. There was a stir inside, a
lid opened, and presently a human head emerged
shaggy as John the Baptist’s, with black hair.</p>

<p>It was the city anchorite, whose sleep or meditation
we had rather rudely disturbed. But he took
it in good part, as one accustomed to allow for
grosser natures, and, raising himself deftly from his
lair, he stood naked before us, contemplating this
garish muddle of a world with shy and melancholy
eyes. Human speech was distasteful to him, but
he had come, he said, from a distant province, the
name of which did not concern a mind set upon
infinity. All his life now he meditated, not directly
upon God, but upon the remembered words of his
Guru, or spiritual master, which in time might lead
him to the meditation upon God Himself. He was
unwilling to say more, and, being in haste, I gave
him six annas (sixpence) as an endowment of meditation,
which appears to me far the most difficult
achievement of the human mind, and he crept back
into his box to continue it.</p>

<p>I was in haste, because I had an appointment
with the Nawab Salimulla of Dacca, certainly the
most influential personality in the city, and perhaps
in the province. For the population of Eastern
Bengal, though nearly all Bengali, is about three-fifths
Mohammedan, and, owing to his father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
wealth, wisdom, and public munificence, the Nawab
is regarded by the Mohammedans as their natural
leader. It is an instance of mankind’s touching
belief in heredity, for the present Nawab is not
specially conspicuous for those three claims to recognition.
His munificence has been largely private,
and, added to certain peculiarities on the part of his
guardian, it has so much reduced his father’s wealth,
that he has been compelled to hand over the remainder
to the Government Court of Wards, having
publicly declared himself a “disqualified proprietor,”
incapable of managing his own affairs. This cannot,
however, in itself imply any lack of wisdom, for
since that public declaration the Government of
India has reappointed him a member of the Viceroy’s
Legislative Council, as one peculiarly capable of
managing the affairs of an Empire. And, indeed,
with regard to the burning question of the Partition,
he has shown wisdom’s reasonable and open mind.
When the Partition was first suggested, he was
as much opposed to it as any Bengali could be, and
I was told that, in his simple-hearted way, he
described it as “beastly.” But such prejudice was
not proof against reason, and it began to dissolve
under the influence of Lord Curzon’s visit, and the
speeches in which he promised that the Partition
“would invest the Mohammedans of Eastern
Bengal with a unity which they had not enjoyed since
the days of the old Mussulman viceroys and kings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Shortly after the Partition the Government of
India advanced a loan to relieve the Nawab’s private
munificence from bankruptcy—a loan amounting
to about £100,000, at what was, for India, a very
low rate of interest. This benevolent action, combined
with certain privileges granted to Mohammedans,
was supposed by many Hindus to have
encouraged the Nawab and his co-religionists in
taking a still more favourable view of the Partition
itself.</p>

<p>Not only so, but priestly mullahs went through
the country preaching the revival of Islam, and proclaiming
to the villagers that the British Government
was on the Mohammedan side, that the Law
Courts had been specially suspended for three
months, and no penalty would be exacted for violence
done to Hindus, or for the loot of Hindu
shops, or the abduction of Hindu widows. A Red
Pamphlet was everywhere circulated, maintaining
the same wild doctrines. It was seen that a large
proportion of Government posts were set aside for
Mohammedans, and some were even kept vacant
because there was no Mohammedan qualified to fill
them. Sir Bampfylde Fuller said in jest that of his
two wives (meaning the Moslem and Hindu sections
of his province) the Mohammedan was the favourite.
The jest was taken in earnest, and the Mussulmans
genuinely believed that the British authorities were
ready to forgive them all excesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>Some two years after his departure from India
Lord Curzon wrote to the <cite>Times</cite> that it was “a
wicked falsehood” to say that by the Partition he
intended to carve out a Mohammedan State, to
drive a wedge between Mohammedan and Hindu,
or to arouse racial feuds. Certainly no one would
willingly accuse another of such desperate wickedness,
but a statesman of better judgment might
have foreseen that, not a racial, but a religious feud
would probably be the result of the measure. What
might have been expected followed. In Comilla,
Jamalpur, and a few other places, rather serious riots
occurred. A few lives were lost, temples were
desecrated, images broken, shops plundered, and
many Hindu widows carried off. Some of the
towns were deserted, the Hindu population took
refuge in any “pukka” house (<em>i.e.</em> house with brick
or stone walls), women spent nights hidden in tanks,
the crime known as “group-rape” increased, and
throughout the country districts there reigned a
general terror, which still prevailed at the time of
my visit. Thus a new religious feud was established
in Eastern Bengal, and when Mr. Morley said in the
Commons that the disturbance was due to the
refusal of Hindus to sell British goods to Mohammedans,
it was a grotesque instance of the power
that officials have of misleading their Chief.</p>

<p>The largest of the Nawab’s palaces, looking
over the river, is built in the French style of Louis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
XIV., but is not so old, having been probably constructed
by the present Nawab’s rich and prudent
father. Similarly, the large collection of knightly
armour in the entrance hall, recalling the onsets of
Cressy and Agincourt, do not suggest that the
present owner’s ancestors were engaged in those
famous battles, as they would in an English millionaire’s
house. As a matter of fact, I believe the
present Nawab’s grandfather or great-grandfather
came from peaceful Kashmir and established the
family fortunes originally on carpets. Since his
time, while the family fortunes have developed, the
family taste has developed too, and the enormous
vaulted room into which I was shown was stuffed
with the expensive sweepings of European furniture
shops. A huge armchair in cut glass especially
fascinated my gaze, and in spite of my haste I had
full time to be fascinated, because the Nawab was
an hour and a half late for his appointment, having
been detained at another palace where a wife dwelt
to whom he was much attached—more attached,
I was told, than to any other.</p>

<p>So there was every excuse for his unpunctuality,
and he made none, but swept into the room with a
smile of benign complacency. He was a well-developed
man of middle age—something of Falstaff’s
prominent personality, but preserving the
childlike air of innocence and candour which nursemaids
call “engaging.” Round his large and serene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
face, which smiled almost perpetually, hung a loose
black fringe of beard. He was dressed in little
purple slippers, thin pyjamas of white silk, a vest
of exquisitely fine Dacca muslin “sprigged” (as
they say in the china trade) with delicate rosebuds,
a copious turban of the same, and a long purple
coat or cloak of flowered brocade, with a white
border embroidered with passion flowers.</p>

<p>“My own design!” he exclaimed with justifiable
pride, as soon as the formal greetings were over,
holding up the stuff for my inspection and slowly
turning round that I might enjoy its full effect.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that though his mind was
much occupied with Imperial politics, he retained
a human interest in home life and the domestic arts.
Like the elder Dumas, he was particularly proud
of his skill in cooking, and he told me of many
wonderful dishes he could make.</p>

<p>“You should taste my nougat!” he cried, and
leaning forward like a diplomat with a State secret,
he added, “Only this morning I composed a new
almond toffee!”</p>

<p>I was not surprised that, with these natural
gifts only waiting to be recognized, he was keenly
alive to a lack of sympathy in his family circle.</p>

<p>“My wife,” (he used the singular, and sighed)—“you
have no idea what difficulty I have in getting
my wife to try a new dish. With her it is always
mutton, mutton, mutton! She has been brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
up on mutton, and Indian women have so little
enterprise. She will not try my dishes.”</p>

<p>“Let us go hence, my songs; she will not
hear,” I quoted in sympathy, and he sighed again.</p>

<p>“Our Indian women are very backward,” he
went on. “Now, there is my retired groom, my
livery man—what a woman his English wife is!
How finished! What pleasantness! How much
nicer a home she makes for him than I can ever
get! I will show you the difference.”</p>

<p>He called an attendant who had been keeping
his eye on me from behind a glass door, and
presently the attendant returned with heavy gold
ornaments—bracelets, anklets, and necklaces—thickly
sprinkled with small turquoises and pearls.</p>

<p>“I gave these jewels as presents to my wife,”
he said. “They are my own design too. I bought
the pearls cheap when the plague was very bad here,
and people were glad to sell everything.”</p>

<p>I commended this one evidence of ancestral
thrift.</p>

<p>“Then I took the pearls and turquoises and
gold to Paris,” he went on, “and drew out a design
for the Parisian jewellers to follow. You see the
result. What grace! What finish I You cannot
get finish in the East. It is the same with our
women. They are backward; they have no
finish.”</p>

<p>By a mere slip of the tongue I said I greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
admired what I had seen of Hindu ladies, and added
something about seclusion and purdah.</p>

<p>“Hindu ladies!” he cried indignantly. “They
don’t understand what purdah is. They might just
as well live shamelessly in public. It is only
Mohammedan ladies who practise strict purdah,
and seclude themselves with absolute delicacy and
refinement.”</p>

<p>I assured him I had supposed no less, and his
aspect cleared again. Resuming his lightsome smile,
he continued—</p>

<p>“For myself I am singularly happy. I suppose
even the Emperor can hardly be happier than
I am?”</p>

<p>He said this in a tentative way, as though
appealing to my personal acquaintanceship with
King Edward. But as I could offer no opinion
upon the Emperor’s happiness, he went on—</p>

<p>“Every morning I feel like a bird. I wake
after my sweet sleep, when the birds are waking
too. 1 like to hear them sing, because I know that
I am as happy as they can be. I have my troubles
of course. I never can induce the gardeners to
water my flowers at the right time. They will
water them in the evening when the cool night is
coming. I tell them they ought to water in the
morning, as a protection against the hot days.
They promise to obey, and next evening out they
go again with their water-pots, as their fathers did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
before them. There is no science in the East, no
progress, no reason.”</p>

<p>For an instant this lamentable truth depressed
him, but he revived at the recollection of his own
assured happiness.</p>

<p>“I trust entirely to God,” he said. “I leave
everything in His hands, and all goes well. He
has always helped me very much. Hitherto He has
helped me so that I hardly ever have to work. He
has never let me work very much, and I trust
everything to His care. I think that is why I am
so happy, and feel like a bird in the morning after
my sweet sleep.”</p>

<p>I suggested that an easy conscience conduces to
sleep and happiness, and he agreed it was so.</p>

<p>He then turned to more general subjects, and,
like Lord Curzon, he much regretted the Bengali
tendency to lying. It was corrupting even the
Mohammedans, and nearly all Indian children were
brought up in deception, usually to escape punishment
or to give pleasure. I remarked that even in
Europe these motives sometimes lead to deceit, but
he had formed an ideal of English education, such
as the Greeks formed of Persian. English boys, he
said, were taught to ride, shoot, and tell the truth.
It was a fine testimony from a man of education so
different from our own.</p>

<p>Of Hindus in general, and of Mohammedans
who had lost their faith, he expressed deep distrust,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
pointing the moral from the fate of a near relation,
who, through associating with women and Hindus,
was now no better than one of the lost. This
grieved me very much, for I had heard that relation
highly spoken of in the town, and he had made me
various offers of kindness. But the Nawab was
inflexible in virtue.</p>

<p>“You must fear God,” he said, becoming for a
moment almost grave. “There is no good in praying
to God, for He needs nothing that we could
give Him in exchange for His gifts. But we know
that He is pleased with truth, and we must tell it.”</p>

<p>Then we discussed the Partition, and as I rose
to go he exclaimed, “Here in Dacca I have 10,000
men ready to die for me if I raise my little finger.
That is how I keep the peace.”</p>

<p>How far he expected to please God by that
statement I do not know. But probably he was
quite sincere, for it is impossible to exhaust or
caricature the illusions of mankind.</p>

<p>One would like to discover the causes of
a certain “quality” (as country people say of
gentlefolk) that appears common to nearly all
Mohammedans. I have felt it almost equally in
Constantinople and other parts of Turkey, in Asia
Minor and Crete, in Morocco, and on the West
African coast, in Madras, in the North-West Frontier
Province, and even in the rather petted luxury
of the Mohammedan College at Aligarh. In all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
places one finds a similar pleasing gravity of manner,
courteous address, and an impression of straightforward
dealing, which, perhaps, would be more
trustworthy if the Sultan were not a Mohammedan.
This gentlemanly manner may exist merely as the
heritage of a conquering religion; for in all these
countries, as in Eastern Bengal, the Mohammedans
have come and stayed as conquerors, and it is easy
to acquire fine and aristocratic manners when you
carry a sword and the other man does not. But
at the back of external behaviour there is a queer
mixture of simplicity and shrewdness more difficult
to account for. It may arise naturally in a mind
reared upon a broad and unquestioned basis of
belief, free alike from the confusion of mythologies
and the distracting details of useful knowledge.
There is a well-known letter, written to a friend
of Nineveh Layard by a Turkish Cadi, that exactly
expresses the finer side of Mohammedan ignorance.
For that reason I quote it in the note below,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>when to this disregard of unessential phenomena in
earth and sky is added an indifference to the controversies,
bare facts, and mechanical actions upon
which most of us spend our lives, we may look for
a certain simplicity tempered by shrewdness. That
even in the Nawab, in spite of his Government loan
and boasted powers of design, cookery, and the
control of men, I should still have been conscious
of both those qualities combined, is a remarkable
testimonial to the influence of Islam.</p>

<p>Owing to these pleasant qualities, so attractive to
Englishmen sprung like myself from the public-school,
country-house, and villa classes, I have almost
invariably found English officers and officials on the
side of the Mohammedans where there is any rivalry
of race or religion at all. And in Eastern Bengal
this national inclination is now encouraged by the
Government’s open resolve to retain the Mohammedan
support of the Partition by any means in its
power. It was against the Hindus only that all the
petty persecution of officialdom was directed. It was
they who were excluded from Government posts; it
was Hindu schools from which Government patronage
was withdrawn. When Mohammedans rioted,
the punitive police ransacked Hindu houses, and
companies of little Gurkhas were quartered on
Hindu populations. It was the Hindus who in one
place were forbidden to sit on the river bank. Of
course, the plea was that only the Hindus were
opposed to the Government’s policy of dividing them
from the rest of their race, so that they alone needed
suppression. And certainly, after what I had seen
in the previous four or five years in Macedonia,
Central Africa, Russia, and the Caucasus, this kind
of persecution might well appear ludicrously small.
But it was the beginning of a dangerous road, to
which one could not see the end, and the knowledge
that our own country was taking that road
aggravated the sense of wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>It was the same with espionage. Personally I
enjoyed being followed by spies wherever I went. I
enjoyed it much more than the spies themselves. It
was a pleasure to watch the open-hearted stupidity
which never left me in doubt as to their purpose, or
to look them tranquilly in the face and see their eyes
drop in honourable shame. It was a joyful moment
when at Serajganj I turned in wrath upon a man who
had been following me all day long in the melodramatic
disguise of a black shawl and an umbrella,
and watched the poor hired worm grovel away, murmuring
tearful appeals about superior orders. In
that case I was angry because I was visiting the
schools—the same over which Sir Bampfylde Fuller
resigned—and it seemed to me unfit that the schoolboys
should see our Government’s habit of espionage
thus illustrated before their faces. But at another
place where I arrived in the cold of half-past three in
the morning, and found that the telegram to prepare
for my arrival had been detained, there was no alloy
in the pleasure with which I seized upon the spy
detailed to dog me, and compelled him to procure
a cart, conduct me to the house where he knew
I ought to have been expected, and knock up the
sleeping servants to receive me.</p>

<p>When I first landed in Bombay, it appeared to
me a little undignified that representatives of the
British Government should set police spies to
question a Member of Parliament’s chauffeur every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
morning and evening where he was going or had
been, and with whom he had conversed. Of course
it made no difference to the Member of Parliament,
any more than the delightful spies in Eastern Bengal
made any difference to me. But what was a joke
to us may be anything but a joke to native Indians
who are compelled to live permanently under a
system of official surveillance which reads their
private letters, detains their telegrams, and hires
men to watch their actions. Far worse than the
mere annoyance involved is the indignant contempt
which our Government thus stores up against itself.
Every now and then by such means it may discover
the trail of some seditious movement. But the discovery
of all the sedition in India would not be
worth the loss of reputation to which we expose
ourselves by resorting to methods that would exclude
a man from any club in our country.</p>

<p>There is something about espionage that stirs
indignation more deeply than anything else in the
world. But I do not wish to part from that land of
great rivers with a mere feeling of bitterness. When
I recall the quiet circuit of streams by which I slowly
passed from Khulna to Barisal, and on to Dacca;
and from Dacca through Mymensingh and Jamalpur
and Serajganj and Goalundo, where the Ganges and
Brahmaputra are joined, to Faridpur, where trains
run back to Calcutta,—I lose the sense of bitterness,
though there was plenty in the country. I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
only of the fertile land basking under an uninterrupted
sky, or of bright crowds of men in yellow,
red, and white standing upon the river bank and
shouting their “Bande Mataram” against the sunrise;
or of long torchlight processions that conducted
some leader of the nation home in his carriage
through the blue night; or of little groups of schoolboys
who had stayed on the platform till the cold of
morning to cheer a passing train, delighted even to
shiver for their country. “I fear we shall never
meet again on life’s rough sea,” said a student at
one place, being naturally proud of such beautiful
English; and, certainly, one cannot hope to visit
the Brahmaputra every week-end. But even from
a good month’s distance, as London is, it seems
impossible to believe that one petulant error can
for all time produce division and rancorous hatred
in so excellent a country and among a people so
devoted to the same causes of freedom and nationality
that we so much admire.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> “My illustrious Friend, and Joy of my Liver! The thing you ask
of me is both difficult and useless. Although I have passed all my
days in this place, I have neither counted the houses nor inquired into
the number of the inhabitants; and as to what one person loads on his
mules and the other stows away in the bottom of his ship, that is no
business of mine. But, above all, as to the previous history of this city,
God only knows the amount of dirt and confusion that the infidels may
have eaten before the coming of the sword of Islam. It were unprofitable
for us to inquire.</p>

<p>“Oh, my soul! Oh, my lamb! seek not after the things which concern
thee not. Thou camest unto us and we welcomed thee: go in peace.</p>

<p>“Of a truth, thou hast spoken many words; and there is no harm
done, for the speaker is one and the listener is another. After the
fashion of thy people thou hast wandered from one place to another,
until thou art happy and content in none. We (praise be to God) were
born here, and never desire to quit it. Is it possible then that the idea
of a general intercourse between mankind should make any impression
on our understanding? God forbid!</p>

<p>“Listen, O my son! There is no wisdom equal to the belief in
God. He created the world, and shall we liken ourselves unto Him in
seeking to penetrate into the mysteries of His creation? Shall we say,
behold this star spinneth round that star, and this other star with a tail
goes and comes in so many years? Let it go. He from whose hand it
came will guide and direct it.</p>

<p>“But thou wilt say to me, Stand aside, O man, for I am more learned
than thou art, and have seen more things. If thou thinkest thou art
in this respect better than I am, thou art welcome. I praise God that
I seek not that which I require not. Thou art learned in the things I
care not for; and as for that which thou hast seen, I defile it. Will
much knowledge create thee a double belly, or wilt thou seek Paradise
with thine eyes?</p>

<p>“Oh, my friend, if thou wilt be happy, say there is no God but
God! Do not evil and then wilt thou fear neither man nor death; for
surely thine hour will come.</p>

<p class="no-indent">All know the crowded Kalighat on the muddy little
branch of the Ganges south of Calcutta. The little
temple of the mother Kali stands close by, where
Hindus keep up an animal sacrifice something similar
to the classic and ancient Jewish rites. Many
Europeans enjoy seeing the heads of the wretched
little goats sliced off by a priest’s sword while the
animals are still dripping from a plunge in the sacred
tanks. Many, like myself, have gone with the
crowding pilgrims on festival Sundays or weekday
evenings and watched the people bathing in the
turbid water, and the Brahmans seated in the open
portico reading aloud the wanderings of Rama and
breaking into song at the impassioned parts. Or we
have stood at the narrow entrance till the door of
the inmost shrine should open, allowing a glimpse
of the goddess herself, the Bengal Mother, symbolic
of the strange Force in nature, always moving irresistibly
on its way with life and death, blessing and
damnation in its hands. Blue-black she is, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>three staring, scarlet eyes, one of them in her forehead.
In her four arms she holds the signs of happiness
and of destruction. One foot is planted on the
body of a man, and from her mouth a golden tongue
protrudes. Her worshippers tell that in her career
of destruction through the universe, she was only
stayed by the intervention of her husband Shiva,
who in the semblance of a dead man flung himself
before her feet to be trampled on. She is represented
pausing in horror at the discovery. To put
out the tongue is the common gesture of shame or
horror among the Indian women, and if it seems
a peculiar expression of those emotions, watch an
English country servant whenever she drops a trayful
of your best china on a stony floor, and she will
almost invariably do the same.</p>

<p>How far this hideous collection of symbols is
itself worshipped is the problem of all imagery and
symbolic art. A priest of Kali, who had himself
received a religious education in one of our missionary
colleges, told me that in the hour of prayer
he found that the image helped him to concentrate
his thoughts upon that idea of universal force. He
admitted that some unlearned worshippers obscurely
connect a supernatural power with the actual image
as it stands; and the great desire of many to draw
near, and even to touch the representation of the
god, seems to prove it, as one may see in all temples
and churches where symbolism prevails. It is rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
strange that Indians, with their beautiful sense of
colour and design, should content themselves with
unusually hideous gods; for, grand as the figure
of Buddha in contemplation is, it stands alone in
its beauty, and now no longer appears in Hindu
forms of worship. Yet the adoration of the Mother
Kali, even at the bloodstained Kalighat, does not
appear to be more horrible or debasing than the
service of other gods. In divine worship, devotion
has never corresponded to external beauty; and as
to the blood sacrifice, that custom has been too
universal, and is still too recent even in the highest
forms of religion, to excite horror or disgust, except
in the tourists who go to enjoy the spectacle. It
seemed to me that the Kali worship did not suggest
the violence of bloodshed, still less the common
lust that visitors are told to associate with it, but
rather a certain heat or fervency that pervades and
sometimes obscures the Bengali mind, taking the
form in some of exaltation, in others of oratory, and
now and then of fluid speech.</p>

<p>All know this crowded Kalighat. But turn
northward again; pass the Lieutenant-Governor’s
beautiful Residency at Belvedere; pass the racecourse
and polo-grounds, the old Fort where the
Commander-in-Chief has his headquarters, and the
Strand where steamers smoke on the river and
the English drive slowly up and down in the evening;
pass the white Government House where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
Viceroy lives in winter, and the dull streets of
English shops where they sell things that are not
quite good enough for England or quite bad enough
for the Colonies; enter the squalid chaos of the
Indian city, so ordinary and colourless compared to
Bombay or Madras; pass through mile after mile
of crowded bazaars, and teeming slums, and factories
jumbled up with temples;—till at last the buildings
begin, as it were, to shake themselves loose, green
reappears, and when you come upon the river on
your left, it looks almost clean and holy; palms
and other trees grow on the banks, and there is a
sense of escape in the air. There you will find
another temple of Kali, spacious, silent, and a home
of peace.</p>

<p>Under a great banyan tree in this temple’s
garden a religious teacher sat for years, and gathered
many disciples round him before his death in 1886.
He was known as Ramakrishna, but he had the
names of Deva and Paramahamsa as well, and there
he sat expounding the things of the spirit, like other
Hindu teachers. But there seems to have been
an intensity of conviction about him that attracted
unusual disciples. Among them was a young Bengali
named Norendra Nath Datta, who took the
more holy name of Vivekananda, and spread his
master’s teaching as far as Oxford and Chicago—cities
so seldom associated together in spiritual
things. He too has gone from this world now—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
went in 1902, at the age of forty—but has left
a school, a kind of religion or Church, that proclaims
a spiritual Hinduism to all mankind without
limitation of race or nation. Its proper name is the
Ramakrishna Society, but the members are generally
called Vedantists, because of their belief in the Vedas
as the inspired guides of man. They abjure images
and sacrifice, except of flowers and fruits, which I
have seen them offer as symbols of thanksgiving
and praise to the spirituality of the universe in their
bare but sufficient little temple up a flight of steps.
By their belief in the Vedas they approach the Arya
Samaj. But their more modern advancement and
universality bring them nearer the Brahmo Samaj,
or cultivated Unitarians of Hinduism, whose freedom
of life and social intercourse for men and
women alike gives a peculiar charm to Indian society
in Calcutta. Small in number themselves, they
stand between these two main bodies of religious
reformers—believers in the Hindu scriptures, but
preachers of a universal religion; free from the
caste restrictions of travel, marriage, and food, but
strongly national in their devotion to the country.
Just across the river, from that peaceful temple of
Kali where their founder sat, they have their little
monastery for the training of about thirty Brothers,
who go out from their pleasant garden to teach all
the world, and to save their own Indian people in
days of plague and famine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>It was in a small circle of these Vedantists that
I first met Moti Lal Ghose, one of the most peculiar
figures of Calcutta life. He is not a Vedantist himself,
being a special worshipper of Vishnu. Indeed,
he follows the Bengali saint Chaitanya, or, as he
prefers to call him, the Lord <span class="smcap">Gauranga</span>, who proclaimed
a purified and emotional form of Hinduism
about the time of Luther, and still has disciples,
especially among outcasts and downtrodden people,
because he promised the love of God to all without
charity’s limitations to the thrifty and deserving.
But devoted Vaishnava as Moti Lal is, one would
think his guiding faith was a sort of clanship or
family affection. They say a hundred relations
make their home in his rambling household among
the little streets of the Bagh Bazar, and that number
would be distracting enough for the most placid of
mankind, which Moti Lal is not. Almost every
one seems to be Moti Lal’s relation, and as, like
many Hindus, he speaks of his cousins as brothers,
and his nephews as sons, the bonds of kinship seem
as close as they are wide. But the affection of his
heart is reserved for his real born brother, Shishir
Kumar, who now has waved adieu to this carnal
world and lives in religious seclusion at Baidianath,
a far-famed shrine of Central Bengal, communing
with spirits whose visitations among men he
chronicles in the <cite>Hindu Spiritual Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>Both the brothers were brought up in the district<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of Jessore, and they made their mother’s village
famous by taking its name of Amrita Bazar for the
title of their paper, the <cite>Amrita Bazar Patrika</cite>—<cite>Amrita
News</cite>, as we should say. It so happens that
the word “Amrita” in Bengali means both “nectar”
and “poison,” and no name could have been invented
to express the character of their paper more
exactly, for it can be sweet or venomous at pleasure,
and is usually both. Its quickness and satiric
power have won it a unique place among Indian
newspapers. It has also a good service of news,
and as for enterprise, when Lord Lytton passed his
Vernacular Press Act in the ’seventies, while Sir
Ashley Eden was Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal,
the <em>Amrita</em> changed its language from the vernacular
Bengali to the alien English in its very next issue.
Such a transformation would have seemed impossible,
if I had not seen the compositors in Madras
setting up my “copy” with hardly a mistake,
though they did not understand a word of English,
and only guessed our letters by sight.</p>

<p>Moti Lal is an oldish man now, as Bengalis
go, but he stands thin and erect, his mass of grey
hair surmounting a face in which pathos, humour,
and subtlety are strongly mingled. It is difficult
to class him among the Indian parties. He often
runs off on side issues, such as his peculiar and
personal indignation at the rational proposal to
separate the large and extraneous province of Behar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
from the Calcutta government, so as to relieve the
pressure of work which was the nominal excuse for
the Partition of Bengal. On most of the wider
questions of policy he would take a fairly steady
“Congress” line, with a tendency to the Left or
Extremist position. But that tendency may be
suddenly interrupted by some queer cross-current,
such as a personal devotion to the Royal Family,
because he was once introduced to the Prince of
Wales, and kissed his feet with a veneration that
might abash even Royalty’s sense of Divine Right.
By means of his paper he is undoubtedly a power
among the party of nationality and reform, but the
general belief that in the past he has exercised a
certain influence even upon British officials is
perhaps justified. At all events, when he asked
me to remind the Lieutenant-Governor of a promise
to restore the Road Cess to its proper purpose of
sanitation, I noticed that the petition was received
in a friendly spirit, and I was instructed to tell Moti
Lal that the proposal had not been forgotten, but
was already embodied in a Bill.</p>

<p>Sanitation is one of those side issues which he
follows with peculiar zeal. Poverty and high prices,
he says, are killing out the educated classes in
Bengal. But worse than the disappearance of educated
Bengalis, which many Anglo-Indians would
regard as a mercy of Providence, is the general
ravage of malaria, plague, and famine. The plague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
is still new, famine has been unusually frequent and
terrible in the last thirty years; but worse than
either, in his opinion, is the malaria which rots the
country away. Like many Indians he attributes the
growth of the disease to the Government railways,
which have blocked or diverted the natural drainage
of the land. The theory sounds a little fantastic.
To me it seems a far more serious matter that the
irrigation, which is often so lucrative, both to the
peasant and the Government, should be accompanied
by increase of fever. But whatever evil
may arise in India, from a cesspool to a famine,
is put down to the Government, as always happens
when the people have no control over its powers
and no experience of every Government’s limitations.
“There is no need to talk about driving
the English from India,” cried Moti Lal to me
once: “In twenty years they will be driven out
by the stench of our rotting corpses!”</p>

<p>Humorous, sarcastic, vehement, probably a little
peevish, a little uncertain and unstable in his dealings
with men and things, Moti Lal moves as a
strange and isolated figure in Indian life. He is
ageing and rather feeble now; when I asked him if
he was going to the Congress at Surat, he answered,
“No, I cannot afford to die.” But he went all the
same. I suppose he might be called a Congress
man, but it seems unlikely that any one ever
thought of him as a possible President, or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
anything else except the bitter-sweet editor of the
<cite>Amrita Bazar Patrika</cite>.</p>

<p>Very different is the editor of the other leading
Indian daily in Calcutta. Mr. Banerjea, whom
every one calls Surendra Nath, is just the ideal of
a leader in Congress, and Poona made him President
in 1895, Ahmedabad in 1902. He appears
to be about sixty now, and in the early ’seventies
he was an assistant magistrate in the Indian Civil
Service, from which he was dismissed for a casual
neglect of duty that in the opinion of many English
Civilians might have been suitably punished with a
sharp reprimand. Like most highly educated people
out of work, he took to teaching, lecturing, and
journalism; became Principal of Ripon College for
the training of Hindu boys, as he still is; was
appointed editor of the <cite>Bengalee</cite> by the proprietors,
who, I believe, are Indian physicians; and has for
many years maintained it in its position as the most
prominent Indian paper written in English.</p>

<p>From early days, when he was the first to
originate tours of political instruction, his influence
has been very powerful, and no one has opposed
the partition of his country with greater vehemence
and persistency. In politics he has shown himself
the fighting man rather than the thinker, a better
leader than guide. Such theory as he has professed
holds him to the Moderate and Constitutional
party, and till it comes to action he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
cordially accept the propositions of all reasonable
and practical reformers. But his instincts might
carry him further than his creed, and in a moment
of crisis he would probably be found in the front
almost out of sight of his party. No matter how
strongly reason and expediency disapproved, he
would be reluctant to hang back from any extreme
position, or to leave a devoted band of defenders
there alone. That appeared to mark him out as
the best intermediary between the Extremists and
the Centre; for, while neither party would look to
him for definite political guidance, both might be
supposed to know that he was at heart their friend,
and both could point to his past services in the
Bengal Legislative Council, the University Senate,
and the old Calcutta Corporation, before Lord
Curzon destroyed it.</p>

<p>The same kind of divergence between reason
and personality causes, I believe, an uncertain
attitude towards other affairs of life. By education
and habit he is Western in the things of society and
religion, and probably would have remained so
without scruple of conscience, but for the recent
revolt against everything foreign. Among the
Extremists there is a kind of conservative reaction
towards Indian ways and Indian religion, prompted
not so much by love of those early marriages and
Hindu gods as by the determination to tolerate
European things no more. Thus, you might find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
an Indian graduate of Oxford worshipping Kali for
the same reason as makes him buy Swadeshi cotton,
or pledging his infant daughter in marriage for fear
she should grow up like an English lady. From
patriotism of this sort Surendra Nath would not like
to stand aloof, and, even if his judgment hesitated,
an impetuous nature would perhaps bear him on,
especially if he could thus assist his associates of the
moment.</p>

<p>But his real function in life is as an orator, and
his eminence has been won by an extraordinary
power of speaking. I do not know how far his
speeches in his own tongue might be effective, but
he served his political apprenticeship at a time when
oratory was tested by a knowledge of English, and
I think he always speaks by choice in our language.
Certainly, his command over it is very remarkable.
Except for Mr. Gladstone, I have heard no speakers
use the grand and rhetorical style of English with
more assurance and success. I remember one afternoon
there was a crowded meeting of many thousand
students and other young men in the great College
Square at Calcutta. There they stood, white-robed,
bare-headed, as is the Bengali custom, and when the
“Bande Mataram” had been sung, Surendra Nath
rose. It was not a specially important speech. His
object was only to sketch out the general programme
of the approaching Congress, and to urge all parties
to unite for the credit of their country, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
being watched by jealous eyes ever ready to detect
the first appearance of a flaw. That was all his
theme, but he expounded it with a magnificence of
phrase, and continuity of expression that held me in
wonder. Sentence answered to sentence, period to
period, thunder to thunder. There was no hesitation,
no throwing back, no wandering for ideas or
words. Out the great language rolled without a
break and without a drop, each syllable in its exact
place and order, each sentence following some
cadence of its own, so inevitable that you could
foretell the stress and rhythm of its rise and fall far
in advance of the actual words, just as you can in
Macaulay’s declamations. It was oratory such as,
I suppose, Cicero loved to practise, and Pitt, and
Brougham—such oratory as few living Englishmen
dare venture on for fear of drowning in the gulfs of
bathos. But Surendra Nath loved it, as Cicero might.
To him it was evidently the sincerest pleasure of life
to listen to the beat of marching phrases, to advance
from one to another with the assurance that not one
of them would fail, and to lead them out in the
martialled order of earth-shaking battalions moving
shoulder to shoulder on their front. It was to him
the fulfilment of function, and that way happiness
lies. After him I spoke, and the meeting ended.</p>

<p>That evening I went to see a Bengali of still
another type, but as distinctive of the present crisis
in the country as the satirist or the orator. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
been arranged, as I supposed, that I should meet
some representatives of the young Nationalist party
which form the staff of <cite>Bande Mataram</cite>, a daily
paper written in English and maintaining Extremist
views, but trying rather carefully to keep within the
law. In that respect it differed from the farthing
paper, <cite>Sandhya</cite> (“Evening”), written in Bengali of
the roughest popular dialect, and deliberately going
all lengths in virulence and abuse. That had been
the policy of its founder and editor, Pundit Upadhya
Brahmabandhab, who had died a few months before
while under trial for sedition. One of the Brahmo
Samaj by training, he had travelled much in Europe,
had lectured in Cambridge, tried to become a Roman
Catholic but failed (so rare a failure!) and on
returning to Calcutta had startled the reformers of
the Congress party by a light-hearted violence that
must have ended in gaol, had not death anticipated
imprisonment by release. In the same way <cite>Bande
Mataram</cite> differed from the vernacular weekly
<cite>Yugantar</cite> (“New Age” or “New Dispensation”),
a revolutionary paper of a more gloomy and solemn
type than the <cite>Sandhya</cite>, but about equally open to
charges of sedition, to meet which it kept a staff of
“prison editors” always ready for the next prosecution.
The first of them to go to gaol was the youth
Bupendra Nath Datta, a brother of the Swami Vivekananda,
who followed Ramakrishna. In the early
summer of 1908 it was prosecuted for the fifth time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
its printer was fined about £67, and sent to hard
labour for twenty-three months, and after Lord
Minto’s new Press Act of June, 1908, it stopped
regular circulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Arabindo Ghose was almost certainly not
connected with the <cite>Yugantar</cite>, but nobody seriously
denied his connection with the English-written
<cite>Bande Mataram</cite>, though that paper also had a staff
of volunteers for prison.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> When I reached the
house in a large square where the meeting was to
have been held, I found it dark and apparently
empty. A Hindu servant let me in, and after a time
Mr. Arabindo Ghose himself appeared alone. He
had not expected me, because the letter about my
coming had been stopped, no doubt by the postal
spies, as he said nearly all his letters were. He had
no special reason to complain of that, nor did he
complain; for the letters from one of the most
respected public men in England to a member of
the Viceroy’s Council had recently been opened in
Bombay, and English people who were friendly with
Indians in Calcutta told me even their letters from
home were tampered with in the same way.</p>

<p>He was a youngish man, I should think still
under thirty. Intent dark eyes looked from his
thin, clear-cut face with a gravity that seemed immovable,
but the figure and bearing were those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
an English graduate. His parents had been half-anglicized,
and had never fully taught him his own
language, so that he could not write Bengali
correctly, or make a speech in the only tongue, as
he said, that really went to the heart of the people.
He had brought himself up amid poverty in
Manchester, St. Paul’s School in London, and at
Cambridge. Though he passed the Indian Civil
Service examinations within the first two or three,
he failed to pass the riding test, and was rejected.
Having served the Gaekwar of Baroda for
a time in the education of that progressive State, he
came to Calcutta, and was now the leader of the
Nationalists, or young Extremists who regarded even
Mr. Tilak as touched with the cautious moderation
of the past. One of his brothers, a poet of
some standing in English, was Professor of English
Literature at the Presidency College in Calcutta
University, and I found him there teaching the
grammar and occasional beauties of Tennyson’s
“Princess,” with extreme distaste for that sugary
stuff. Another brother was supposed to belong to
a different branch of the Extremists.</p>

<p>Arabindo’s purpose, as he explained it to me, was
the Irish policy of Sinn Fein—a universal Swadeshi,
not limited to goods but including every phase of life.
His Nationalists would let the Government go its
way and take no notice of it at all. They hoped
nothing from reforms; all the talk about Legislative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Councils and Indian members and the separation of
Judicial and Executive functions was meaningless to
them. They did not spend a thought upon it. In
fact, the worse the Government was, the more repressive
it became, and the less it inclined to reform, so
much the better for the Nationalist cause. He
regarded the Partition of Bengal as the greatest
blessing that had ever happened to India. No
other measure could have stirred national feeling so
deeply or roused it so suddenly from the lethargy of
previous years.</p>

<p>“Since 1830,” he said, “each generation had
reduced us more and more to the condition of sheep
and fatted calves.”</p>

<p>He lamented the long peace, leading to degeneracy
and effeminate ways. Under it the ordinary
people had sought only after prosperity and material
comfort, while the thoughtful men spent their time
in æsthetic circles, admiring Shelley and Swinburne,
or imitating them. The more English a man was,
the more he counted himself successful, and the life-blood
of nationality had run thin. But all this torpor
and smug contentment had been rudely interrupted
by the disguised blessings of Lord Curzon’s errors.
Indignation had again created patriotism when apparently
it was dead, and the new party’s whole policy
was aimed at carrying forward the work that Lord
Curzon had so successfully begun for the revival of
national character and spirit. For this purpose of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
building up a race worthy of a great name they proposed
to work on the three lines of a national education,
independent of Government but including the
methods of European science; a national industry,
with boycott of all foreign goods except the few
things that India could not produce; and the
encouragement of private arbitration, in place of the
law-courts, for the settlement of disputes.</p>

<p>But behind these simple means a deeper spirit
was at work. Arabindo Ghose had already, I think,
formed the project of developing out of the Congress,
or in place of the Congress, a nationalist and democratic
body that would prepare the country for
self-government and, indeed, act within limits as
a true Indian Parliament quite apart from the
Anglo-Indian system. A few weeks later, a leading
article on the subject, probably written by Arabindo
himself, appeared in <cite>Bande Mataram</cite>—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Let us try the experiment,” it said, “of a self-governing
popular assembly, so far as is consistent with
the existence of an alien bureaucracy seeking to restrict
our independent activities in every possible way. No growth
is possible under perpetual tutelage. We must devise means
for stimulating activities on the part of our people. This
cannot be better done than by organizing a really representative
assembly that in its annual or periodic sittings will
decide on our course of action. It does not necessarily
follow that such an assembly will come into collision with
the powers that be. We have every right to organize
ourselves independently. The agitators have so long been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
taunted with absolute dependence on the bureaucracy that
people cannot reasonably try to repress an assembly for the
offence of carrying out their own precepts.... As they
cannot see their way to giving us any real voice in the
administration, even in a dim and distant future, we have no
other course open to us. Let us relieve the bureaucratic
administration of as much of its duties as we can by undertaking
to govern ourselves in as many departments as
possible.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Courage, he rightly saw, was the first thing to
maintain or to create in any people, especially in
a subject people like the Bengalis, who had so long
been taunted with cowardice by one master after
another. The taunt of cowardice is like one of those
prophecies that fulfil themselves. It implants the
cowardice that it derides, and if you call a people
timid they begin to shake. Ever since Macaulay
wrote, the Anglo-Indians had been brought up by
their schools and coaches to regard the Bengalis as
the cowards of the world, and what was far worse, the
educated Bengalis had been taught to regard themselves
as the cowards of the world too, just because
Macaulay had delighted himself one morning with
a brilliant passage of rhetoric.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Where the consciousness of timidity exists among
a people, the first duty of a patriot is to remove it at
all costs. So in the columns of his paper and in his
rare speeches Arabindo Ghose was insisting especially
on the necessity of courage:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Courage,” said a leader in <cite>Bande Mataram</cite>, “is your
principal asset. Heroism, says Emerson, feels and never
reasons, and therefore is always right. If you are to work
out the salvation of your country, you will have to do
it with heroism. You have voluntarily cut yourselves off
from outside help to develop strength from within. Darkness
will hem you round, disappointments will cross your
path, slander will pursue you from behind, but you are to
depend on yourselves, and yourselves alone. You must
press on and not allow yourselves to be dragged back by
encumbrances in the name of unity. You have your only
guide in the loftiness and spirituality that make their heaven
in the thought of the wider light and purer happiness that
you may bring to your country by long force of vision and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
endeavour. The rapturous contemplation of a new and
better state for your country is your only hope. What
great element is wanting in a life guided by such a hope?”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There is a religious tone, a spiritual elevation, in
such words very characteristic of Arabindo Ghose
himself, and of all Bengali Nationalists, contrasted
with the shrewd political judgment of Poona
Extremists. In an age of supernatural religion
Arabindo would have become what the irreligious
mean by a fanatic. He was possessed by that concentrated
vision, that limited and absorbing devotion.
Like a horse in blinkers, he ran straight, regardless
of everything except the narrow bit of road in front.
But at the end of that road he saw a vision more
inspiring and spiritual than any fanatic saw who
rushed on death with Paradise in sight. Nationalism
to him was far more than a political object or
a means of material improvement. To him it was
surrounded by a mist of glory, the halo that mediæval
saints beheld gleaming around the head of
martyrs. Grave with intensity, careless of fate or
opinion, and one of the most silent men I have
known, he was of the stuff that dreamers are made
of, but dreamers who will act their dream, indifferent
to the means. “Nationalism,” he said, in a
brief address delivered in Bombay, early in 1908—“Nationalism
is a religion that comes from
God”:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Nationalism cannot die, because it is God who is
working in Bengal. God cannot be killed, God cannot be
sent to gaol. Have you got a real faith, or is it merely a
political inspiration, a larger kind of selfishness?... You
all know what Bengal used to be; you all know that the
name of Bengali used to be a term of reproach among
nations. What has happened? What has made the Bengali
so different from his old self? One thing has happened,
Bengal is learning to believe. Bengal was once drunk with
the wine of European civilization, and with the purely
intellectual teaching that it received from the West. It
began to see all things, to judge all things, through the
imperfect instrumentality of the intellect. When this was
so, Bengal became a land of doubters and cynics....</p>

<p>“The intellect, having nothing more to offer save despair,
became quiescent, and when the intellect ceased to work,
the heart of Bengal was open and ready to receive the voice
of God whenever he should speak. When the message
came at last, Bengal was ready to receive it, and she
received it in a single moment. In a single moment the
whole nation rose, the whole nation lifted itself out of
despair, and it was by this sudden awakening from a dream
that Bengal found the way of salvation, and declared to all
India that eternal life, immortality, not lasting degradation,
was our fate....</p>

<p>“There came a time, after the first outbreak of triumphant
hope, when all the material forces that could be brought to
bear against Nationalism were gradually brought into play,
and the question was asked of Bengal, ‘Can you suffer?
Can you survive?’ The young men of Bengal were
now called upon to suffer. They were called upon to bear
the crown, not of victory, but of martyrdom....</p>

<p>“It is not by any mere political programme, not by
National Education alone, not by Swadeshi alone, not by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
boycott, that this country can be saved. Swadeshi by itself
might merely lead to a little more material prosperity, and
you might forget the real thing you sought to do, in the
glamour of wealth and in the desire to keep it safe. In
other subject countries also there was material development....
When the hour of trial came, it was found that
those nations which had been developing materially were not
alive.... The forces of the country are other than visible
forces. There is only one force, and for that force I am
not necessary, you are not necessary, he is not necessary.
Let us all be thrown aside as so much waste substance, the
country will not suffer. God is doing everything. When
He throws us away, He does so because we are no longer
required. But He is immortal in the hearts of His people.”</p>
</div>

<p>This fervour of nationality, which some would
call fanaticism, certainly appears to differ in degree
from the religious fervour with which we pray for
the High Court of Parliament, “under our most
religious and gracious King at this time assembled.”
But it would be no compliment to ourselves to
doubt that at the back of both there is a unity of
spirit.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>As to fanaticism of language and the violence
that cannot keep outside the limits of sedition, I
have seen violent and bloodthirsty passages translated
from the <cite>Yugantar</cite>, the <cite>Sandhya</cite>, the <cite>Hitaishi</cite>
(“Friend”) of Barisal, and other vernacular papers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Such papers are fined, suppressed, have editors imprisoned,
and under the new Press Act may have
their type confiscated. But in none of them have
I seen more deliberate attempts to stir up race
hatred and incite to violence than in Anglo-Indian
papers which suffer nothing. Take, for instance,
this obvious instigation to indiscriminate manslaughter
by the <cite>Asian</cite>, an Anglo-Indian weekly in
Calcutta (May 9, 1908):—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Mr. Kingsford has a great opportunity, and we hope he
is a fairly decent shot at short range. We recommend to
his notice a Mauser pistol, with the nickel filed off the nose
of the bullets, or a Colt’s automatic, which carries a heavy
soft bullet and is a hard-hitting and punishing weapon. We
hope Mr. Kingsford will manage to secure a big ‘bag,’ and
we envy him his opportunity. He will be more than
justified in letting daylight into every strange native approaching
his house or his person, and for his own sake we trust
he will learn to shoot fairly straight without taking his
weapon out of his coat pocket. It saves time and gives the
elevation fairly correctly at any distance up to about ten or
fifteen yards. We wish the one man who has shown that
he has a correct view of the necessities of the situation the
very best of luck.”</p>
</div>

<p>That was written certainly at a time of great
excitement, when an attempt had been made to assassinate
the unpopular magistrate by a bomb, which
killed two ladies, not only innocent, but related to
one of those exceptional men whose sympathy with
the people makes them justly beloved. But two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
can play at the evil game of race hatred, and if the
Indian press is violent, the tone of the Anglo-Indian
press is almost invariably insolent and provocative.
If “seditious” only means “likely to
lead to violence,” it is seditious too. There are
fine exceptions, like the <cite>Statesman</cite>, the <cite>Indian Daily
News</cite>, the <cite>Empire</cite>, and <cite>Capital</cite>, in Calcutta. Steadily
supporting the official side, though with great
freedom of criticism, as was shown in the case of
Lord Curzon, the <cite>Pioneer</cite> of Allahabad maintains an
honourable tradition. But as to Anglo-Indian
papers like the <cite>Englishman</cite> of Calcutta and the <cite>Civil
and Military Gazette</cite> of Lahore, it must have been
difficult for any thoughtful Indian who loved his
country to read them during 1907 without cursing
our race. Even the <cite>Times of India</cite>, the best paper
in Bombay, greeted Mr. Keir Hardie’s arrival in the
city with a whole column of insults, not only to the
Labour leader, but to the Indian people. Judging
from the style, I thought the editor must have
bribed some poor, half-educated Indian to do the
thing for him; but I heard afterwards, through one
of the staff, that it was written by an Anglo-Indian,
who was quite proud of his achievement. What
cause he had for pride may be seen from a paragraph
or two:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Mr. Keir Hardie’s reception in Bombay was thoroughly
in keeping with the rest of his experiences, and foolishly
ebullient proceedings. All along the mountains have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
in labour; to the disappointment of excited and expectant
Babudom the mighty throes have never produced more than
here and there the proverbial mouse. Fifty Hindus, and a
couple of Parsis: what a deputation from the wealthiest
and most progressive commercial city of the East, what a
characteristic greeting from the great heart of Indian labour
to the personification of the political labourite spirit! Even
this bathotic manifestation of the deplorable fact that the
Oriental is almost entirely devoid of humour, as completely
so as the labouring man and his chosen apostle, must needs
miscarry. The fifty Hindu schoolboys and their two Parsi
companions cannot find the god of their idolatry. Perchance
he sleepeth, and cannot hear, or will not hear the
piping yell of ‘Bande Mataram’; at any rate look where
they will in the compartments commonly occupied by their
beloved agitators and demagogues, not a sign of this one is
to be found. Topknots and draperies flying wildly to the
winds, they race up and down chattering discordantly,
baffled, desperate till at last, ‘proh pudor,’ they find him,
not occupied in great meditations, not even spouting platitudes
to the circumambient air, but prosaically strapping up
his exiguous baggage, in a second-class compartment.
‘Cophinus foenumque supellex.’ A damper this and no
mistake. Deputation from the dumb millions of India
brimming over with enthusiasm and verbosity, subconsciously
dominated by the traditional respect of the East for
superior men, men to be looked up to, men on the summits,
what to say to this essentially and markedly labelled second-class
product!...</p>

<p>“Does it not occur to this man of the people, uncultured,
illiterate, with at the best a stunted and perverted imagination,
does it not occur to him, and the astuter ones who are
making him their cat’s-paw, that his enterprise is not only
radically mischievous but overwhelmingly ridiculous? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
appeal from masses to masses, the slogan of gutter to
gutter, cementing all the forces of inferiority, inefficiency,
and serfdom, preludes war against all that is best and sanest
and strongest in life. It is the voiced concentration of
hatred, the hatred which the sick and the feeble and the
bad by some strange law of antagonism cannot help cherishing
against the healthy, the great and the good. On the
one hand Aristocracy, the rule of the best, on the other
Democracy, the rule of the mob, that ‘bellua centiceps’
representing again by the inexorable laws of nature what
for the time being is the worst.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
</div>

<p>And for the time being we certainly need not
look, even from Democracy, for anything worse
than that!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> As Macaulay is no longer thought generally necessary to education,
it may be worth while to recall a few sentences of his indictment
of a whole people nearly twice as numerous as his own. The passage
comes in his essay on Warren Hastings: “A war of Bengalis against
Englishmen was like a war of sheep against wolves, of men against
demons.... The physical organization of the Bengali is feeble even
to effeminacy. He lives in a constant vapour bath. His pursuits are
sedentary, his limbs delicate, his movements languid. During many
ages he has been trampled upon by men of bolder and more hardy
breeds. Courage, independence, veracity, are qualities to which his
constitution and his situations are equally unfavourable. His mind
bears a singular analogy to his body. It is weak even to helplessness,
for purposes of manly resistance; but its suppleness and its tact move
the children of sterner climates to admiration not unmingled with
contempt. All those arts which are the natural defence of the weak
are more familiar to this subtle race than to the Ionian of the time
of Juvenal, or to the Jew of the dark ages. What the horns are to
the buffalo, what the paw is to the tiger, what the sting is to the
bee, what beauty, according to the old Greek song, is to woman, deceit
is to the Bengali.” And so on, for many more sentences of nicely
balanced rhetoric.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It was roses, roses all the way—almost all the way
during the forty-four hours in the train from
Calcutta to Surat; and along the last part of our
journey every platform was crowded with eager,
smiling faces straining to catch sight of the future
President of the Congress, and the long-trusted
leaders who accompanied him. Dr. Rash Behari
Ghose had been designated President by the Reception
Committee at Surat, in spite of stormy opposition
in favour of Mr. Tilak at a conference in
Nagpur some two months earlier, and the subsequent
proposal of Lajpat Rai by Mr. Tilak himself. He
stood smiling at the carriage door, and answered
with short speeches of thanks and encouragement.
Or he walked the platform, and sat at station tea-tables
while old men and youths hung long garlands
of marigolds and jasmine round his neck, presented
him with bright bouquets of flowers sparkling with
“fairy rain,” or sprinkled his coat and hands with
Swadeshi scents from long silver bottles. Others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
were with him—Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, the
orator, Mr. Aswini Kumar Dutt, the leader of
Barisal, members of the Chaudhuri family conspicuous
in Calcutta, and many other well-known men
who for years past had tried to carry on the work
of constitutional reform in the face of Anglo-Indian
ridicule, contempt, and hatred. A few younger
men were there also, men of another party, who
had abandoned appeals and petitions either to Anglo-Indian
or British justice.</p>

<p>But the chief attention was centred on Dr.
Ghose—Rash Behari, as people called him—a large,
spectacled man of sixty-two, with strongly marked
face and the general look and bearing of a European
judge. From his student days at the Presidency
College in Calcutta he had devoted himself to the
law. He obtained the highest honours the University
gives, he lectured in law, he produced the
standard work on the “Law of Mortgage in India.”
I suppose he was exactly what people mean by a
jurist. He prided himself also on a minute
acquaintance with the whole range of the English
classics, and it is almost impossible to read a page
of his speeches without coming upon memories of
some great passage in our literature. For he
belonged to the time when education and capacity
were estimated by a knowledge of English, and he
had besides a genuine delight in the form and
substance of words. But civil law was his life’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
business, and in the knowledge of it he was called
unrivalled.</p>

<p>He had taken to public politics late, only when
the pressure of Government upon the growing
national feeling appeared to him dangerous. But
the weight of his knowledge, and his influence as
one of the representative Indian members on the
Viceroy’s Legislative Council brought him quickly
into notice, and in the previous December (1906)
Calcutta had chosen him Chairman of the Reception
Committee for the Congress, to which Dadabhai
Naoroji had been brought from England as President
to preserve the peace. Like all lawyers, he tended
to moderation. He represented the spirit of the
Congress as it had been established for more than
twenty years—the spirit that had begun by hoping
to win even Anglo-Indian consideration for its
programme of reform, and, after abandoning that
hope, still did not despair of influencing opinion in
England, if only petitions and proposals could be
heard.</p>

<p>His danger was the danger of all students—of
all whose life is spent among writings that usually
appeal to reason, and not among men, with whom
reason plays so small a part. When it comes to
action, such students are likely either to distrust
themselves, to hesitate between opposite courses, in
both of which they perceive advantages, and in
hesitation finally to submit their wills to far inferior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
intellects, out of a kind of awe towards men who
have really done something. Or else they may
show a childish impatience at disagreement, and
suppose they have settled a controversy by ending
it, like shutting a book with a bang. I thought the
judicial hesitancy rather than impatience would be
Dr. Ghose’s temptation, but I was wrong, for he
had, in fact, recently displayed a very decisive
vigour in joining with Mr. Gokhale in denouncing
the Seditious Meetings Bill on the Viceroy’s
Council.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>So amid acclamation they travelled to the Congress—the
President-Elect and the other leaders.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day Surat was reached at last—a
little old town on the west coast, between Baroda
and Bombay, where early traders from England,
France, Portugal, and Holland had built their
“Factories,” soon after Akbar’s death. The crowd
round the station was so tightly jammed that it was
a long time before any one could leave the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>By reasoning and entreaty the youthful bands
of “Volunteers” in khaki and forage caps at last
cleared a space. A procession of carriages was
formed and began to advance step by step through
the shouting throngs of orange, crimson, and white-clad
people. All the windows and tottering balconies
of the beautiful but decrepit city that starves upon
its past—even the galleries of Islam’s crumbling
minarets and the roofs of Hindu temples—were
crammed with faces. Women peeped through
shutters or stood shamelessly beside their children
and brothers. Boys and girls thrust their heads
through holes in the ruinous walls. At every few
yards more garlands were offered, more bunches
of flowers and sweet-smelling seeds. Thick fell the
showers of rose-water sprayed from silver bottles.
On every side rose the great cheer of “Bande
Mataram!” From end to end the streets were
hung with strings of pink and yellow paper flags,
and here and there a triumphal arch uttered the
universal welcome in Indian or English words. The
great Pandal, or Pavilion, for the Congress, and
the camp of tents pitched around it for the delegates
from all India stood by the river side beyond the
town itself. The distance was not much over two
miles, and yet that journey took more than two
hours to accomplish, so high ran the enthusiasm
of joy.</p>

<p>But, behind the shouting and the triumph, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
heard the quiet voice that whispers of mortality.
In the grey light of Christmas morning, as we came
through some obscure junction in the train, we had
heard that Mr. Allen, the collector of Dacca, had
been shot on the platform at Goalundo in Eastern
Bengal, and his life was despaired of. Mr. Allen
did in the end recover, but at the time recovery was
said to be impossible, and the news threw the same
gloom and consternation over the Indian party of
reform as struck the Irish Home Rulers on the
news of the Phœnix Park murders. The month
before there had been an attempt to wreck Sir
Andrew Fraser’s train as he was returning from
Orissa; but this was the first political assassination,
and every one knew that it would be answered by
more repression, leading to further outrages and
more repression again. Nothing worse could have
befallen the party that still hoped for some sort
of agreement in reform and conciliation with the
country’s far-off rulers, and the mute despondency
that fell upon the leaders in the train showed the
depth of their foreboding.</p>

<p>Even more ominous were the whispers of growing
and violent division that reached us at Surat.
The Extremist or Nationalist party had taken a new
and decisive step in pitching a separate camp for
themselves in a distant quarter of the town. For
the last two days Mr. Tilak had been there, organizing
and addressing them. The day before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
had held a full meeting of five hundred delegates,
with Mr. Arabindo Ghose in the chair, and Mr.
Tilak had spoken at length on the situation, especially
denouncing the rumoured withdrawal of the
Moderate party from the previous year’s Calcutta
resolutions upon Self-government, Swadeshi, Boycott,
and National Education. Such a withdrawal was
not to be endured. Rather than submit they would
oppose the election of the President himself, even
though the chair was waiting to receive him.</p>

<p>The resolutions were nowhere to be seen.
Rumour said they had been altered past recognition.
The heading of a Draft Constitution for the Congress
was found. There it stood written that the
ultimate goal of the Congress was “the attainment
by India of self-government similar to that enjoyed
by the other members of the British empire.”
That was Mr. Gokhale’s work! How inferior to
the Calcutta resolution that “the system of Government
obtaining in the self-governing British Colonies
should be extended to India”! “Other members of
the British Empire” might mean Crown Colonies,
Dependencies, anything! The Self-governing
Colonies must be the model, and nothing else!
That the heading of the draft implied nothing else,—that
no one in his senses would apply the word
“Self-government” to a Crown Colony, did not
matter. Undermining ways were at work! The
Calcutta resolutions were being tampered with!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
the Moderates were capturing the Congress in the
enemy’s interest! It was not to be endured.</p>

<p>The whole air was full of suspicion. The mere
choice of Surat for the Congress after Nagpur was
abandoned—how suspicious that was! Surat, too
close a neighbour to Bombay, the very stronghold
of “Bombay Moderates”—Parsis, mere Parliamentarians,
unredeemed by the fire of sacrifice, men
who would make the best of both worlds, men who
took titles from an alien Government! It was in
Surat that Sir Pherozeshah Mehta had founded his
fortunes. Now he dominated all the west coast,
all the Presidency of Bombay, and here he was seen
with Mr. Dinshaw Edulji Wacha, most statistical of
Parsis, himself President of the Calcutta Congress
in 1901. All the other obedient satellites were
circling round him too, bent on conciliating a
Government that answered conciliation with titles or
contempt. Was a National Congress to be manipulated
by mitred Parsis? It was all very well to
plead Sir Pherozeshah’s services to India in the past—in
the days when, as a disciple of Ranade himself,
he had stood almost alone against the bureaucracy,
had displayed a courage equal to Mr. Gokhale’s, an
eloquence hardly second to Surendra Nath’s, a power
of sarcasm hardly rivalled by Moti Lal’s; had been
chosen President of the young Congress in 1890;
had conquered for Indians the control of the Bombay
Corporation; had converted his city into a model<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of local government; had swept away her slums
and purged her administration. To the suspicious
Nationalist these things were nothing now. They
belonged to the past, to the scrap-heaps of dead
reputations. The crisis called for other arms, other
methods. It was no longer a battle of slums and
water, no longer a thing of appeals for sympathy
and dear old Lord Ripon’s reforms. Even Sir
Pherozeshah’s address at the Bombay Congress only
three years before was now suspect. He was chairman
of the Reception Committee, and one remembered
the passage which ran:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“My steadfast loyalty is founded upon the rock of hope
and patience. Seeking the will of Providence, like Oliver
Cromwell, in dispensations rather than revelations, seeing
God’s will, like him, in the fulfilment of events, I accept
British rule, as Ranade did, as a dispensation so wonderful—a
little island set at one end of the world establishing itself
in a far continent as different as different could be—that it
would be folly not to accept it as a declaration of God’s
will. But, as I have often said, when, in the inscrutable
dispensation of Providence, this country was assigned to the
care of England: the choice was offered to England as to
Israel of old: ‘Behold I have placed before you a blessing
and a curse; a blessing, if ye will obey the commandments
of the Lord your God; a curse, if ye will not obey the
commandments, but go after other gods, whom ye have not
known.’ We cordially confess that, in the main, England
has chosen wisely and well.... But the acceptance and
announcement of a policy of righteousness is one thing, its
application is another.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>To the suspicious Nationalist the time for such
language was three years past. Such compliments,
such protests, all belonged to the age of innocence,
before the Partition of Bengal proved the real
character of England’s domination and the futility
of protest and of compliment alike. It was known
that in a Provincial Conference lately, here in Surat
itself, Sir Pherozeshah had secured the exclusion of
the great questions of Boycott and National Education
apart from Government aid. All evidences
pointed one way: the Bombay Moderates were not
the men for times like these; the Bombay Moderates
must go!</p>

<p>So in the Nationalist camp suspicion cried aloud,
and indignation grew on rumour. In the afternoon
of Christmas Day, just before the President-elect
arrived in insecure triumph, Lala Lajpat Rai himself
went to the Nationalist camp—Lajpat Rai, the quiet,
fearless man, with all the honour of dishonour still
upon him; a Moderate, a close friend of Gokhale,
but a patriot above suspicion, the man put forward
as President by the Nationalists themselves, had he
not refused to stand rather than hasten the dangerous
breach. Surely he, if any one, might serve as
peacemaker. He proposed a conference between
the parties, five leaders aside. The Nationalists
appointed their representatives—Mr. Tilak, Mr.
Arabindo Ghose, Mr. Khaparde of Nagpur, and two
others. On the bare hope of peace, Lajpat Rai<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
sought Mr. Gokhale at the station as the President-elect
steamed in. What a moment to arrange a
conference! How could even Mr. Gokhale appoint
five leaders to represent sixteen hundred delegates?
For the twenty-two years of its existence the
Congress had settled the form of its resolutions by
a “Subjects Committee,” which met for discussion
in the evening after the Presidential address. Why
depart from constitutional usage now?</p>

<p>So behind Rash Behari’s triumphal carriage,
amid the shouting and the garlands and the flags,
death, distrust, and suspicion whispered of mortality.
That night few slept. Backwards and forwards,
from tent to tent and house to house, the leaders
passed, discussing, consulting, deliberating, full of
uncertainty and apprehension. Morning found
them still apprehensive and uncertain. In a last
effort to secure Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, if
not peace, Mr. Tilak, Arabindo Ghose, and Mr.
Khaparde went to his house with proposals. Mr.
Moti Lal Ghose, of the <cite>Amrita Bazar Patrika</cite>,
went with him as peacemaker, though that remarkable
man had qualifications for the task about on a
level with a porcupine’s. To Surendra Nath they
proposed two conditions under which they would
refrain from opposing the President’s election:
the four Calcutta resolutions on Self-government,
Swadeshi, the Boycott, and National Education must
be repeated in the same form as last year, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
“graceful allusion” must be made by one of the
speakers on the election of the President, “to the
desire of the public to have Lajpat Rai in the Chair.”
To make such an allusion graceful at such a moment
might have puzzled even Surendra Nath’s eloquence.
But he was not the man to abandon either party in
their need. He undertook both conditions for
himself, and advised the Nationalists to seek an
interview with Mr. Gokhale or Mr. Tribhovandas
Malvi, a Surat gentleman, chairman of the Reception
Committee, and supreme in the Congress till
the President was elected. They did not attempt
to see Mr. Gokhale. Mr. Malvi could not see
them, because he was engaged in prayer.</p>

<p>One by one the fateful hours of the morning
passed away. By noon the Congress delegates and
the vast audience who had paid for seats began to
gather in the Pandal. The meeting was to have
begun at one, but, to allow time for burning the body
of a Scinde delegate who had died, it was put off till
half-past two. The delay was unfortunate. In that
enormous pavilion of striped canvas full ten thousand
people were already assembled. The architect had
constructed it for something over ten thousand, and
every place was full. The delegates from all the
provinces of India, with a few to represent the
Indian grievances in the Transvaal, numbered
perhaps sixteen hundred, of whom five hundred
might be called Extremists of one kind or the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
On the platform sat some thirty to forty Indian
ladies, Parsis, for the most part, but Hindus and
even Mohammedans as well, significant of a deeper
change than politics. The other thousands were
the indistinguishable audience who had come to
listen, or perhaps do more than listen. The whole
interior, constructed on different levels so that all
might see, rose and fell in waves of brilliant turbans,
orange, crimson, gold, and white, according to the
provinces from which they came, and in a black and
solid square sat the bare-headed delegates from
Bengal. Under the burning sun that pierced the
roof the whole of that vast crowd remained for
hours, disputing, arguing, exhorting each other in
groups and districts, a dubious exercise of patience.</p>

<p>The platform people began to arrive. Among
the first came Dr. Rutherford, Member of the
Mother of Parliaments, now visiting India in hope
of understanding a little of her distress. At his
side was another of “the ruling race,” come for the
same purpose. As they advanced up the centre of
the throng applause and shouts of “Bande Mataram”
received them, but under all the shouting one
heard low, penetrating hisses and angry cries of
“Shame!” from men who no longer endured a
sign of British rule, not even in the way of friendship.
Then a quiet, white-turbaned figure, with
sad determination in his look, entered from the side.
Like one man, the ten thousand sprang to their feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Cheer followed cheer; it seemed as though the
cheering would never cease. Who does not love
the man that has suffered for a cause? It was
Lajpat Rai.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the Volunteers were
seen lining the central passage again, and up the
midst in a solid body came Dr. Rash Behari Ghose,
President-elect; Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, the mitred
Parsi; Mr. Wacha, the sane, unwearied master of
statistics; Mr. Surendra Nath Banerjea, the orator
of Bengal; Mr. Gokhale, whom some were tired of
hearing called the Just; and other leaders of the
Congress, famous and trusted for twenty years. At
the sight, opposition shut its voice. The cheering
rose, and rose again. In honour done to patriots
so long conspicuous and so tenacious against contempt
and failure, it seemed as though the day
might yet pass without a rupture. The platform
was reached. Mr. Tribhovandas Malvi, Chairman
of the Reception Committee, rose to welcome the
Congress in the name of his native Surat, and there
was silence. He told the history of Surat, and
passed on to the history of the Congress. People
do not want to hear history when they are making
it. Moghuls, Mahrattas, French Factories that
stood on their very ground where now the Pandal
stood—what did all of them matter? King Shivaji,
he was dead. The early efforts of the Congress,
the failures, the successes—all were dead. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
present moment was alive and big with futurity.
For heaven’s sake, come to the present moment!
So the assembly waited, impatient, but in silence,
save that at the word “moderation” a breath of
murmur stirred.</p>

<p>The address ended. Dewan Bahadur Ambalal
S. Desai, late Chief Justice of progressive Baroda,
learned in law, in banking, and commercial enterprise,
rose formally to propose that Dr. Ghose,
already designated President, should now take the
Presidential Chair. At the name of Ghose, the
deep murmur of dissent was heard again, and one
shrill voice cried, “Never!” But the moment the
Dewan sat down, Mr. Banerjea was seen standing
in his place beside the table—Surendra Nath, the
hero of a hundred platforms, grey-bearded son of
thunder, youthful still in the service of the cause,
by reason and temperament friend and champion of
both parties alike. He was to second the proposal
that Dr. Ghose should take the Chair. Hardly had
his immense voice uttered ten words when, like the
cracking of thunder that begins before the lightning
ceases, the tumult burst, and no word more was
heard.</p>

<p>Waving their arms, their scarves, their sticks,
and umbrellas, a solid mass of delegates and spectators
on the right of the Chair sprang to their feet
and shouted without a moment’s pause. Over their
heads was the label, “Central Provinces”—Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
Provinces where Nagpur stands and the Congress
was to have been. “Remember Nagpur!” they
cried; “Remember Midnapur!” where, during
the Bengal Provincial Conference a week or two
before, Surendra Nath had attempted to keep the
peace against the Extremists, and had actually sat
on the same platform with a District Superintendent
of Police! White turbans from Madras joined
them. The whole ten thousand were on their feet,
shouting for order, shouting for tumult. Mr. Malvi,
still half in the Chair, rang his brass Benares bell,
and rang in vain. Surendra Nath sprang upon the
very table itself. Even a voice like his was not a
whisper in the din. Again and again he shouted,
unheard as silence. He sat down, and for a moment
the storm was lulled. The voices of the leaders
were audible, consulting in agitated tones—Dr.
Ghose shrill, impatient, and perturbed with anger;
Mr. Gokhale distressed, anxious, harassed with vain
negotiation and sleepless nights. Already one caught
the word “suspension.” “If they will not hear
Surendra Nath, whom will they hear?” said one.
“It is an insult to the Congress,” said another.
“An insult to Bengal!” cried a third. Again
Surendra Nath sprang on the table, and again the
assembly roared with clamour. Again the Chairman
rang his Benares bell, and rang in vain. In an
inaudible voice like a sob he declared the sitting
suspended. The platform rose, Surendra Nath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
descended, the Indian ladies, who had beguiled the
long waiting by chanting the hymn of “Bande
Mataram” with quavering voice, filed out through
a door at the back, and the leaders of the Congress
movement disappeared into tents prepared for them.</p>

<p>After twenty-two years of steady and regular
procedure the Congress had broken up in less than
an hour. To the excited groups into which the
great assembly split it seemed incredible. As when
a growing child overturns the family routine and
is astonished to find its parents distraught and
weeping, so the Extremists stood a little amazed
and dumbfounded at what they had done. Wild
defence was met by wild denunciation, but no
violence followed. It was still a polite and peaceful
people, anxious to leave conciliation open. I conversed
with Mr. Kelkar of Poona, editor of the
<cite>Mahratta</cite>, as Mr. Tilak’s lieutenant. The outbreak,
he said, was accidental and unexpected. They had
determined to oppose Dr. Ghose’s election, but not
by tumult; they would not even have opposed it
had not the Moderate offer of compromise come too
late. I visited the Nationalist camp, far across the
town, and found Mr. Tilak himself, just returned
from his dubious triumph, sitting naked in his
cloth. He gave me the same assurance. The
whole thing had been a mistake; it had all happened
because the undertaking to renew the Calcutta
resolutions had reached him too late—not till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Chairman had begun his speech. The resolutions
had then been handed to him by Mr. Gokhale, and
he had admitted he would himself have been satisfied
if certain changes in their wording had been removed
and the original form restored. But by that time
it was too late to reassure his followers, or re-establish
his authority for peace.</p>

<p>It is hard to say how far this difficulty about the
Calcutta resolutions was vital, or how far a sincere
desire for peace might have explained it away. The
mere delay in supplying them to Mr. Tilak was
accidental—the fault of a Surat printer. Mr.
Gokhale has said so, and his word is above suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
But he admits that “slight verbal alterations had
been made in one or two of them to remove
ambiguity,” and it was left, as usual, for the Subjects
Committee to decide in what form they should
finally be submitted to the Congress. Unhappily,
after the events of the day, there was no chance or
thought of a Subjects Committee meeting, and the
disputed alterations remained unsettled. Some
were obviously unimportant, unless a quarrel was
desired on any straw. The change from “the
system of government obtaining in the self-governing
Colonies” to “the self-government enjoyed by
other members of the British Empire” in a draft
constitution implied no change of meaning, but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
hearing of the criticism, Mr. Gokhale had himself
inserted the word “self-governing” before
“members of the British Empire.” In the Swadeshi
resolution, the Calcutta version had promised “to
stimulate the production of indigenous articles by
giving them preference over imported commodities
even at some sacrifice”; in the new draft this
sentence appeared as “to stimulate the consumption
of indigenous articles by giving them preference
where possible over imported commodities.” Here
the omission of the words “even at some sacrifice”
was due to the inaccuracy of the newspaper copy,
from which the resolution was taken. In the
Calcutta resolution about National Education the
clause proposing “to organize a system of education—literary,
scientific, and technical—suited to
the requirements of the country on national lines
and under national control” had been altered in the
new draft to a proposal “to organize an independent
system of education—literary, scientific,
and technical—suited to the requirements of the
country.” Mr. Gokhale defended the alteration on
the ground that it avoided the triple repetition of
the word “national,” was more restrained in form,
and “more in accord with what was being actually
attempted in different parts of India.” In the
changes so far there was nothing to split a party
determined to preserve its unity.</p>

<p>The difference in the remaining resolution was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
vital. It went to the very root of the difference
between the parties, and for the sake of it alone the
proposed changes remain worthy of notice. In the
original Calcutta resolution the Congress was “of
opinion that the Boycott Movement inaugurated
by Bengal by way of protest against the Partition
of that province was and is legitimate.” In the
new form proposed for discussion in the Subjects
Committee the wording ran, “This Congress is of
opinion that the Boycott of foreign goods resorted
to in Bengal by way of protest against the Partition
of that province was and is legitimate.” All the
difference between Moderates and Extremists—just
the one point which made genuine conciliation
impossible—lay implied in that small difference of
wording. “Boycott of foreign goods” was plain;
it was a necessary part of Swadeshi, whether used
as a political protest or as an encouragement to
Indian industries. But “Boycott Movement”
might mean the rejection of almost anything—the
rejection of foreign goods, of foreign justice, foreign
appointments, foreign education, foreign authority,
taxation, Government itself. Already it had been
so interpreted, both at the Calcutta Congress and
frequently throughout the year. To yield on this
point would be to hand over the Congress to
Extremists for ever, to abandon the first principles
of the Congress, which had been to work out the
salvation of India in association with the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
rulers, and endeavour, in spite of Anglo-Indian
mockery and hatred, to invoke the sense of justice
which must somewhere surely lie in the heart of so
great and free a people as the English. If these
first principles were now to be abandoned, if the
Congress was to be pledged to call upon India to
go her own way, regardless of the English people
and the English Government, the Congress as it
had hitherto existed might as well give up the
pretence of existence, and bequeath its effects to a
new and different force. Here was no half-way
house, no common ground for compromise. The
alteration in the wording was vital.</p>

<p>On this difference at the root negotiation failed.
The Boycott resolution was perhaps not even
mentioned, but at the back of men’s minds the
difference lay. Through the evening and night
negotiations continued. The Nationalists held
another conference in their camp. Unless the
Calcutta resolutions were replaced in the original
form, they were instructed to oppose the election
of Dr. Ghose, but to allow all speakers a fair hearing
and create no tumult. Envoys passed between the
camps; could not a joint committee of the parties
meet for discussion? Could not Mr. Gokhale and
Mr. Tilak meet? Could not Surendra Nath act
as conciliator? Could not Dr. Rutherford, Member
of the Mother of Parliaments, be asked for the
advice of historic experience? Backwards and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
forwards the negotiation went, and during that night
also few slept.</p>

<p>The morning of December 27th again found
them at variance, still uncertain, their mood more
fretted by sleeplessness and anxiety. But a general
anticipation of peace prevailed, because all foresaw
what the enemies of reform would say if the Congress
collapsed. By noon the Pandal was again
full to overflowing. At one o’clock the Presidential
procession entered. Again Dr. Rash Behari Ghose
bore with him the printed copy of his Presidential
address, which ought to have been delivered the
afternoon before, and had, unhappily, appeared that
morning in some of the Calcutta papers, with an
attack upon the Extremists still unaltered.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
his side, as before, came the familiar Congress
leaders, and amid stormy applause that breathed
defiance to interruption, they took their seats behind
the green table that stretched the whole length of
the high-raised platform, before which there was
no railing, but only, as it were, an escarpment for
defence.</p>

<p>In the front row of the delegates, not in the
place reserved for him on the platform, Mr. Tilak
was seated. As the procession entered he sent a
note to the Chairman by one of the boy Volunteers
to say he wished to speak on the election of the
President after the seconder had spoken. According
to his own account, he added, “I wish to
move an adjournment with a constructive proposal,”
apparently referring to another special conference of
delegates from both sides. According to the Chairman
and others who claimed to have seen the note,
it proposed “an amendment for the adjournment
of the Congress.” It was a difference much argued
afterwards, but the note itself had disappeared into
chaos and could no more be recovered than the
Sibyl’s leaves that flitted round her cave.</p>

<p>In deliberate and expectant silence the proceedings
began. Mr. Malvi called upon Mr. Banerjea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
to take up his speech, seconding the appointment
of Dr. Ghose as President. Speaking with a
chastened exuberance, as of a hero rebuked by fate,
Surendra Nath appealed to the past achievements
of the Congress, appealed to the necessity of union
for strength, and sat down amid silence, amid
applause. Mr. Motilal Nehru, wealthy barrister of
Allahabad, circumspect and respected, Moderate by
nature in everything but generosity, said a few
sentences. Every one went delicately, moving on a
crust of ashes. In inaudible words Mr. Malvi
proposed that Dr. Ghose should take the Chair as
President, and amid various shouting he declared
the motion carried. Heavy with years and knowledge,
Dr. Ghose transferred himself to the seat,
and rose at once to deliver that thoughtfully prepared
address. “Brother Delegates, Ladies and
Gentlemen,” he began, “my first duty is to tender
you my thanks for the signal honour you have
done me.”</p>

<p>Beyond his first duty he never went. As when
lightning flashes in air surcharged with storm, Mr.
Tilak was seen standing straight in front of the
Presidential Chair itself, expostulating, protesting,
all in that calm, decisive voice of his, the voice of
a man indifferent to fate. He had given notice of
an amendment, he was there to move it, and there
he would remain. “You cannot move an adjournment
of the Congress,” cried Mr. Malvi; “I declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
you out of order.” “I wish to move an amendment
to the election of President, and you are not in the
Chair,” Mr. Tilak replied. “I declare you out of
order!” cried Dr. Ghose. “You have not been
elected,” answered Mr. Tilak; “I appeal to the
delegates.”</p>

<p>Uproar drowned the rest. With folded arms
Mr. Tilak faced the audience. On either side of
him young Moderates sprang to their feet, wildly
gesticulating vengeance. Shaking their fists and
yelling to the air, they clamoured to hurl him down
the steep of the platform. Behind him, Dr. Ghose
mounted the table, and, ringing an unheard bell,
harangued the storm in shrill, agitated, unintelligible
denunciations. Restraining the rage of Moderates,
ingeminating peace if ever man ingeminated, Mr.
Gokhale, sweet-natured even in extremes, stood
beside his old opponent, flinging out both arms to
protect him from the threatened onset. But Mr.
Tilak asked for no protection. He stood there
with folded arms, defiant, calling on violence to do
its worst, calling on violence to move him, for he
would move for nothing else in hell or heaven.
In front, the white-clad audience roared like a
tumultuous sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly something flew through the air—a
shoe!—a Mahratta shoe!—reddish leather, pointed
toe, sole studded with lead. It struck Surendra
Nath Banerjea on the cheek; it cannoned off upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. It flew, it fell, and, as
at a given signal, white waves of turbaned men
surged up the escarpment of the platform. Leaping,
climbing, hissing the breath of fury, brandishing
long sticks, they came, striking at any head that
looked to them Moderate, and in another moment,
between brown legs standing upon the green-baize
table, I caught glimpses of the Indian National
Congress dissolving in chaos.</p>

<p>Like Goethe at the battle of Valmy, I could
have said, “To-day marks the beginning of a new
era, and you can say that you were present at it.”</p>

<p>The Indian ladies vanished. The platform
leaders withdrew rapidly through a door at the back
of the Pandal. Mr. Tilak was borne off by his
followers. But in the vast pavilion itself a combat
raged at large. Chairs, useless now except as
missiles, flew through the air like shells discharged
at a venture; long sticks clashed and shivered;
blood flowed from broken heads. Group rushed
upon group, delegate upon delegate. Breathing
slaughter, they glared for victims. It was hard to
tell friend from foe. Ten thousand men, all
crowded together among ten thousand chairs, no
uniform, no distinction, nothing to mark off Extremist
from Moderate except the facial expression
of a temperament—it was a confused and difficult
conflict to maintain. Who would wish to fall to
the bludgeon of a political friend? Nor was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>certain chivalry or politeness wanting. Standing
in the midst on a chair from which I could command
the scene, I watched two champions, beaked vultures
from the North, belabouring each other with
murderous intent. By an adroit stroke one brought
his stick down on the other’s skull, and knocked
his turban off. Instantly a truce was granted till
the many yards of long white turban had been
rapidly rolled tight again, and then with fresh fury
the contest was renewed.</p>

<p>So with varied incident the combat swayed and
raged and crackled. Suddenly the police appeared—no
mistaking them in their short blue uniforms
and the little clubs that made no political distinctions.
Only about thirty entered, but thirty men who
know what they want are to ten thousand who are
not quite sure like a dog to sheep. With them
came their Superintendent, their Inspector—Scottish,
small and wizened as a prize jockey, calmly ordering
here, ordering there, protected in the roaring turmoil
only by courage and a penny cane. Bit by bit the
tumult was driven out by the doors into the open.
Within an hour the vast Pandal, strewn with broken
chairs, sticks, and rags of raiment, stood empty as
a banquet-hall deserted.</p>

<p>Even that night negotiations were again renewed.
But suspicion had now gone too deep, and, as in
an instinctive quarrel, each attempt at conciliation
revealed a new distrust. Next day (December 28th)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
opened with savage rumours of bloodshed, but two
hundred police now guarded the wreck of the
Pandal, and there, in anxious and regretful security,
a convention of nine hundred Moderates met.
They had signed an agreement to preserve order,
to promote reform by constitutional means, and to
aim at self-government similar to the self-government
existing in other parts of the Empire. Dr.
Ghose was in the Chair, some of the prominent
leaders spoke, and a committee was appointed to
watch events. The most significant point in the
meeting was the presence of Lajpat Rai upon the
platform, and his declaration that he would continue
to fight under the old banner of the Congress was
at such a moment worth a thousand men.</p>

<p>The Convention then turned to consider the
woes of Indians in the Transvaal, whose delegates
had been wandering about in the chaos, tearfully
lamenting the vanity of human wishes. In the
afternoon the Extremists also held a convention,
and also appointed a committee to watch events.
In the large courtyard of a private house they met
in silent crowds. Grave and silent—I think without
saying a single word—Mr. Arabindo Ghose took
the Chair, and sat unmoved, with far-off eyes, as
one who gazes at futurity. In clear, short sentences,
without eloquence or passion, Mr. Tilak spoke till
the stars shone out and some one kindled a lantern
at his side. He reviewed the situation, accused the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
“Bombay Moderates” of seeking favour with the
Government and rejecting the Nationalist offers of
compromise. He had no wish to destroy the
Congress, for its prestige was useful; but a new
spirit had entered Indian affairs, and unless the
Congress was permeated with the new spirit it had
better die—it was dead already. By the new spirit
he meant self-confidence and self-assertion, contrasted
with the old methods of petitions for rights,
appeals for justice, and other forms of mendicancy
which the British Government answered with elusive
promises, and the Anglo-Indians with scorn.</p>

<p>So, on that note of deep and perhaps irreconcilable
divergence, the twenty-third Indian National
Congress ended. Many delegates remained in Surat
for a day or two, taking part in conferences upon
child-marriage, widow-remarriage, the education of
women, Indian industries, the drink problem, the
revelations of the Divine Will, and other questions
of permanent interest for Indian life. But the
Congress was over. The work of the old Congress
as it had existed for all those years was rolled up
and done. Re-union of Moderate and Extremist
in some form might still be possible; for a militant
party, a nationalist party, an Opposition is never
long divided, and oppression is a fine reconciler.
But breach or no breach, all felt the Congress would
never be the same again. In the twinkling of a
shoe it had been changed, and a new spirit, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
different and difficult spirit, had indeed arisen in
the country.</p>

<p>As I returned with the leaders of the Congress
movement in the train, each station rang with shouts
of “Down with Rash Behari!” “Down with
Gokhale!” “Down with Surendra Nath!” Not
a cheer, not a single cry of “Jai!” That was on
a Sunday, and on the Wednesday before no cheering,
no garlands had seemed enough. It had been
roses, roses all the way.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Towards the conclusion of his speech came the following characteristic
sentences: “I oppose this Bill because it violates all the traditions
which have up to this time guided the Government. I oppose this
Bill because I wish to see the English Rule broadbased on the people’s
will, and not resting merely on the sword, whether Indian or British.
And, lastly, I oppose this Bill because it will kill all political life in
this country.... One word more. It is unfortunate that the 1st of
November should have been fixed for this meeting. That day has
always been associated in our minds with the gracious Proclamation of
Queen Victoria. It will now be associated with the loss of one of our
most cherished rights.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">[52]</a> The main part of the address was a sorrowful indictment of Mr.
Morley’s government during the year, an answer to the Arbroath
speech, and a criticism of the professed Simla reforms. It then passed
to the situation between the two parties in India, and concluded with
a strong repudiation of the Extremist position, and a warning to
Extremists “not to be beguiled by phantoms, nor to expect they could
end the British rule by boycotting the administration,” whereas their
only chance lay in co-operation with the Government in every measure
likely to hasten their political emancipation. At the end of the copy
which Dr. Ghose gave me, and which he intended to read to the
Congress, was a manuscript note expressing deep regret at the murderous
attempt upon Mr. Allen in Eastern Bengal, and the following peroration,
also in manuscript:—</p>

<p>“I call upon you to fight for your rights, resolved not to be beaten,
nor even knowing when you are beaten. To doubt of victory is to
doubt the justice of our cause. It is to doubt our courage and the
strength of our combination. It is to doubt the honesty and sincerity
of a great people who are bound by every obligation of duty to redeem
their pledges. It is to doubt the irresistible force of moral power in
the affairs of nations. We may be baffled for a time, our efforts may
be abortive, but I have faith in the justice of our cause, faith in your
patriotism, in the English nation, and in the sword of the avenging
angel. Let us then work, not in sorrow or despondency, but in the
joyful assurance that our cause will triumph and our country take her
rightful place in the Federation of the Empire.”</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">A City of God</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I had escaped to the Ganges, as myriads of transitory
pilgrims have escaped before. From the
distractions of politics and the dust of practical
reforms I had come to the quiet river, sliding under
immemorial walls. The water was still white and
dove-coloured with morning, but already along the
thin crescent of the shore, white-robed men and
women were coming down the steps with naked feet,
and silently approaching the edge. They threw
long strings of marigolds into the stream. Stooping
down, they scooped up the water in brazen pots,
and set a marigold upon the mouth of each. Hung
with flowers, and bearing on their foreheads the
triple mark of the god, men settled cross-legged
upon slabs of stone or wooden platforms, and
plunged at once into prayer, or, opening long and
narrow books, began to recite aloud the words of
inspired ancestors. Men and women alike, still
draped in white, walked step by step down into the
water, till it passed over their heads, and then came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
back step by step, and stood dripping in prayer.
They raised water in their hands, splashed it three
times on their mouths and foreheads, and with arms
lifted to the risen sun, poured what was left back
into the river. Covering her face with her hands,
one girl knelt upon the bare stone so long in adoration
that the sun dried her one white length of sari,
and it hung loose around her form again.</p>

<p>The common life of the holy city began, and
the calling of the milkmen, the cake-sellers, the
fruiterers, and drivers of bullock-carts mingled with
the temple bells. They brought the dead down to
the river, hung with marigolds, and wrapped in
cotton cloths as when they lived. Pushing them
feet forwards a little way out from shore, they let
them soak in the holy water until wooden pyres
should be ready to consume their deserted forms,
happy in a double purification. Washerwomen
carried down their bundles of linen, and swung each
piece over their heads again and again upon flat
stones in the water, until it was cleansed, with the
added advantage of sanctity. Ascetics in brick-dust
robes passed up and down among the crowd, bearing
long staves in memory of their vow to constrain
their thoughts, their speech, and their desires. Other
ascetics, dressed only in a transparent coating of
ashes, sat in perpetual contemplation, forgetful of
the body and the world. One man I saw in faded
yellow robe, worn by sun and rain, passing quietly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>in and out of the worshipping throng, as he followed
the little footpath by the water’s brink. He was
of those who all the year long tread the bank of
the Ganges, from her source in the mountains to
her mouth among the forest swamps, and back again
to her source in the mountains. On that day’s
walk he happened to be passing again through her
most sacred city, but that seemed hardly to interrupt
his contemplation of her holiness.</p>

<br>

<p>“Yours is the Order I should belong to by
nature,” I said, giving him a halfpenny, for which
he had not asked.</p>

<p>“For you it would be easy and difficult,” he
answered, in good English, and led me up many
steps and along galleries overhanging a cliff of
ruinous masonry to a cool courtyard, where Brahmans
are daily fed on boiled rice and salt, laid out
upon a plate of stitched banana leaves.</p>

<p>“Obviously it would be easy for you as for any
one,” he went on as we climbed up, after his meal,
to the top of the flat roof where a little shelter had
been erected for shade and worship; “but for you
it would be difficult also, because you hang upon
the world, and your soul is entangled in illusions
and desires. Like all your people, you call the
unreal things realities, and for reality you have no
name.”</p>

<p>Having devoted himself for a while to prayer,
he continued: “You see this low parapet? Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
years ago a boy was seated upon it reading a Sanscrit
book of wisdom, when, it is thought, a monkey,
inspired by the god, pushed him, and he fell. Look
over and you will see the projecting slab half way
down which he broke as he fell. They gathered
up his shattered body, and laid it, almost alive, in
the Ganges. I cannot doubt that he attained at
once to salvation, his soul returning to the universal
consciousness, as the space inside a pot returns to
universal space when the pot is broken. And in
his salvation I may claim a share, for I was his
father.”</p>

<p>It was noon, and the sun blazed upon the roof.
Green parrots flew screaming among the trees of a
garden far below us. The hum of the city arose,
pierced with loud cries, and over the far-off iron
bridge across the Ganges a train was slowly passing
with prolonged and shrieking whistle. But still the
crowding pilgrims moved down the steps to the
water’s edge, and bathed and offered flowers, and
stretched up their hands in silent adoration, or recited
ancient and sacred words aloud.</p>

<p>“It is possible for you,” I said, after a long
time, “to desire escape from the danger of rebirth,
and to speak of being merged in the universal consciousness
as salvation. But how about these people
who come in millions to the river? All their lives
they struggle only to live. From day to day their
thought is only to keep alight their little glimmer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>of life, and hand it on to others who are their
children. How is it to be supposed that they come
to the river so wearied of existence as to pray only
to be saved from being born again? I myself, who
am one of them, would walk in the opposite direction
if I thought the river was going to extinguish my
life, and for choice I should rather be born a mouse
than nothing.”</p>

<p>“You remind me,” he answered, “of those
worshippers of Vishnu, who pray in great humility,
‘Let me be born a cat or dog, if only I may love
thee, O God.’ It is a great prayer, and you may
join in it, for, being a wanderer through the world,
you can always hope to become a religious man,
avoiding the many-sided degradation of which people
tell me who have visited the West. I, too, was
once engaged in common business, managing large
estates in this very city, and I know the rich men
in the streets, though they cannot now tell who
passes them so close. But each day I gave much
time to contemplation, and I took the vow of kindliness
to every living thing, just as you see those
Jain monks there who are feeding ants with sugar,
and would not wittingly kill a cholera germ; or
like those wandering Sisters of the faith who wear
a strip of white felt across their mouths lest they
should breathe a midge to death, and carry soft
brooms in their hands to sweep the place where
they are about to sit, lest the weight of their frail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
bodies should crush an irrecoverable life. By such
means, even in your present body, you may begin
to penetrate the illusions of existence, and at rare
moments may perceive some gleam from what one
of your poets has called the white radiance of
eternity.</p>

<p>“As for these pilgrims,” he went on, “they
are like a woman who lights her cow-dung fire at
evening, not considering as she cooks that the flame
is composed of ten divisions, each symbolic of a
faculty of the soul. Or they are like a man who
walks by the light of sun and moon, not considering
that sun and moon are nothing but symbols of
creative power, as are men and women, fire and
water, heat and cold. Or they are like the nautch
girls who have a separate song for every hour of the
day and night, but do not know that their songs
are only the pulses of eternity. In cooking, in
light, and in song, each finds an ignorant joy, and
in the same way these pilgrims have a dim sense
of righteousness and purification in the outward
symbols of truths that they will never learn in
their present life. By such means, for a few hours
together, they may free themselves from the illusions
of existence, and in some cases even reach
the state of those highly religious men who devour
putrid cats, to prove that in their estimation all
material things are alike, all being equally unimportant.</p>

<p>“But for people like you,” he continued with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
pity, “what can one say? You are still ensnared
by political anxieties, artistic interests, and the
desires of personality. You have far to go before,
by contemplation and hard discipline, you perceive
how like happiness is to its opposite—how accurately
the joy of existence may be compared to a
fire-fly wandering in an unlimited vault of darkness,
or to the inch of cool shadow thrown by a snake’s
head upon a burning desert. Till you can reach
that supreme state when birth, and life, and death
have no separate meaning, you have far to go. But
there is always hope for one who will begin by
overcoming earthly desire. For, as you may have
heard, there has been one being and one alone who
in this flesh attained to salvation without death, and
he was Janaka, the father of Sita, Rama’s wife. He
sat still, you remember, with one hand in a blazing
fire and the other upon a woman’s breast, showing
that to him the one was the same as the other, and
both indifferent.”</p>

<p>We descended, and I went away in the rapid
twilight, sorrowful because I was not in the least
like Janaka. But as I went, I came to the courtyard
of a temple to Shiva, the dissolver of existence, and
there in the darkness I found a lonely woman walking
round and round a sacred tree, driven by the
blind desire to bear a child. So untameable among
the unlearned is the passion for life.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Cold!” I said, just for something to say, as I
came out of the dak-bungalow into the thin January
air before sunrise, and met an educated Indian, who
said “Good morning!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered. “You’d have thought
it cold if you had slept where I did.” And he
pointed to a dusty place, where he had evidently
been lying in front of the house.</p>

<p>“Why on earth did you sleep there?” I asked;
“there was plenty of room inside.”</p>

<p>“I’m a Famine official, and I have been living
inside for some nights past,” he answered. “But
when I got back at nine o’clock last night, I found
you were reading in one room and your boy had
gone to sleep in the other, so I stayed out here.”</p>

<p>“My boy!” I said. “Why, he sleeps everywhere!
On the floor of my room, at the door—anywhere!
Why didn’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” he answered, with hesitation,
“I saw you were an Englishman, and I knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
if I had come in, you’d have kicked me out, and I
didn’t want to be kicked out. That’s why.”</p>

<p>As I had been three months in India, I was not
surprised, but as a patriot I found it hard to reply,
so I turned the conversation to Famine and Relief.</p>

<p>We were in the United Provinces, where that
season’s famine was particularly bad. Mr. Theodore
Morison has explained that in India the word
“famine” is now equivalent only to a “suspension
of agricultural industry.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> “Now that the relief
of the unemployed is undertaken by Government,”
he says, “it is not a fact that any considerable
proportion of the people die of hunger
when the agricultural industry is interrupted.” In
the United Provinces, then, agricultural industry
was suspended, and the cause of the suspension
was obvious. For close on four and a half months
not a drop of rain had fallen, and day after day
the sun rose and set in a sky as clear and hard
as steel. Rain ought to have lasted well into
October, and in December to have begun again,
and here was the second week in January without a
drop since August. The December harvest was
lost, and the ground so hard that scarcely a quarter
of the usual crops had been sown for the greater
harvest due in March. The horror of past famines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
is easily obliterated in India, for what would you
expect of a people to whom history is but a sleep
and a forgetting? But men who had known the
course of Indian famines since the seventies told me
that unless rain came within a fortnight that year’s
famine would be worse than any that India had ever

<p>Coming twenty or thirty miles south of the
Jumna from Allahabad, where the Jumna and Ganges
join, I had passed through a country that became
continually more desert. It was nearly flat, and
rather thickly covered with isolated thorns and the
heavy mango trees, which yield a fruit much sought
after by the villagers, but now regarded as a chief
cause of cholera in famine time. So far, the trees
had not been stript bare for fodder, as I afterwards
saw them round Delhi, and the cattle were still kept
from the unholy butcher’s hands by a diet of chopped
millet stalks, with linseed for the milkers. The
land was divided into tiny fields, about the size of
one to four tennis-courts, marked off by earthen
banks, along the top of which there is a right of
way. Round the mud villages, wherever the wells
still held water, some of these fields were green with
potatoes or young wheat, or a tall bushy pulse with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>yellow flower, and all day long the ryots were busy
distributing the precious water through little channels
among the crops. I suppose no form of
irrigation surpasses the wells in value, though very
many of them are sunk only temporarily in times of
drought, on account of the expense of sinking a
“pukka” or masonry shaft. As in most parts of
India that I visited, the water is usually drawn up
in one or two large bags by bullocks harnessed to
the end of a rope and driven down a steep incline.
But many of the wells were dry, and so were many
of the tanks or public ponds, which, having originally
supplied most of the mud for the village
habitations, afterwards become the social centres of
village life. In fact, the only tank I saw with a
plentiful supply of water left was one that three
crocodiles had wisely selected for their home. They
were not so large as the dragonish monsters I had
shot at in West Africa, but large enough to disturb
the social centre of any English green. Two or
three hundred yards away from the village wells the
little squares and oblongs of fields were absolutely
bare, not a weed showing. For miles on miles the
drab surface of the earth was hard and barren as a
brick pavement.</p>

<p>The famine in Orissa was due to flood—an
unforeseen calamity—and though the area was small
in comparison, the horror of the starvation was
much worse than anything in the United Provinces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
The effect of drought can be foreseen, and it is one
of the Government’s recognized functions to keep
people alive in famine. Preparations for relief had
begun in October, and at the head of the administration
stood Sir John Hewett, the Lieutenant-Governor,
in whom all Indians felt a peculiar
confidence. But apart from his special influence, it
is in famine time, as I have noticed before, that the
zeal and sympathy of our officials are seen at their
best. Men who in ordinary seasons would treat all
Indians alike with habitual contumely, are perfectly
willing to die for them in their distress, and once I
travelled in a cabin with a high legal official in
Allahabad, not connected in any way with relief,
whose voyage out was made more and more miserable,
because at every port came the news of
continued drought in the province. Such sympathy
from above is a memory of our old land-owning
traditions, a relic of noblesse and its obligations, and,
as long as our superiority is as undisputed as a
captain’s or a curate’s, we are particularly successful
in exercising this devoted patronage.</p>

<p>As no rain fell, “test works” were established
in December. On test works heavy tasks like road-making
are set, and no payment is given unless
the work is done. Nothing but real poverty and
hunger will drive people to work of this kind, and
so, when two thousand men were found to be labouring
at each of the test works, it was assumed that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>hunger was general, and “a state of famine” was
officially proclaimed. A state of famine implies
relief works on which the Government pays a fixed
rate of wages to all workers, and assistance of some
kind is given to every one—women, children, babies,
and the old, as well as the able-bodied workers.
The rate is decided by the Famine Commissioner
according to his estimate of the price of grain. In
this case he had calculated the price of grain for the
time being at 18 lb. (9 seers) to the rupee (1<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>).
By the “Wages Table for Public Works,” which is
as easy to work with and as indisputable as a table
of logarithms, this price gave the rate of wages at
2<em>d.</em> a day for diggers, whether men or women (but
hardly any women consent to dig), 1½<em>d.</em> a day for
carriers of earth (chiefly women), 1<em>d.</em> for children,
and ½<em>d.</em> a day for babies.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>A few exceptional cases are specially treated.
Any woman, for instance, who presents the works
with a new baby is rewarded with a special donation
of 1<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> down. The wages were paid out of a
guarded treasure tent every afternoon, and the
people bought their own food from local merchants,
who generally conveyed the grain on the backs of
bullocks from Allahabad. The women ground it
themselves, and made it into a sticky paste with a
little salt, and that was what the families lived upon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Drinking water was served from kerosene tins by
Brahmans so that none might be defiled.</p>

<p>Villagers in want of the wage looked round the
plain at sunrise for a red flag hoisted on a long pole.
That showed the “recruiting station,” and there the
families congregated in long rows, waiting to be
allotted to gangers chosen from their own number.
If any were already too starved for labour, they were
fed up to working point; but there were none of
the brown skeletons here that I saw in Orissa,
because, as the disaster was not sudden, the relief
had begun while the people were still in good
condition. When the gangs were arranged, they
were led out to some allotted portion of the works,
the fellow-villagers remaining together for the
stimulus of public opinion. In other districts the
relief works took the form of new roads, but where
I was the engineers had designed two great bunds
or dams to catch the monsoon rains over a large
and gently sloping area. For a few months each
year shallow tanks would thus be formed, which
could be tapped as required for the fields at a lower
level, and, when dry, would leave a surface enriched
with silt and moisture. The dams were called
Garhaiya Kalan and Telghana from neighbouring
villages, and one was seven miles long, the other a
mile and a half. If these were not sufficient for the
winter’s relief work, many more might be constructed,
and the Government could always hope to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>recover part of the outlay by the increased value of
the land, for which the landowners (zemindars)
would as usual have to pay about half their income
as revenue. And as I thought of it, I sighed for
the orgy of battleships and old age pensions which
we should enjoy if only our Government at home
could scoop up the unearned increment like that!</p>

</p>
<br>

<p>The process of constructing the dams was simple.
Engineers had fixed the required levels and breadths
by upright poles with strings stretched between
them, and all that the workers had to do was to
pile up earth till the strings were just covered and
disappeared from sight. The earth was cut from
both sides of the dam, and each digger’s daily task,
with the help of a woman carrier, was to clear a plot
of earth 13 ft. by 8 ft., and 1 ft. deep. A pick and
hoe were supplied by Government, but the natives
refused the new English-made tools, not from any
Swadeshi prejudice, but because they were rotten
and would not cut. Women carried the earth in
baskets made in the gaols and threw it on the dam.
Weaker women, cripples and children broke up the
clods, patting them rather gently with wooden
implements till the surface was fairly smooth and
solid. That was all the work. If the allotted task
fell short, the payment of the whole gang of fellow-villagers
was reduced, so that each worker had an
interest in keeping all his friends up to the mark,
and I did not hear any complaints about reductions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
What I did hear were the common complaints of
humanity that bellies were not full, that dealers gave
short weight, and that some parts of the ground
were harder to dig than others. By that time there
were twenty thousand workers on relief in this small
district alone, and the numbers were daily increasing.
When people have to be saved by averages of
thousands together, how can you stop to give complete
satisfaction? It is not so that heaven is filled.</p>

<p>The hope was that, as the famine had been
taken in time, the cholera, which comes in the rearward
of famine, might be avoided; and it was.
The only definite disease I noticed was a very common
paralysis of the knees, which crippled both
men and women, but was not directly due to famine.
The people themselves attributed it to a kind of
pea they eat, and the pea had lately been forbidden
to be sold on Government works. I had seen the
same kind of paralysis in the stone quarries at Les
Baux in Provence, where it was attributed to the
dust; but it seems hard to connect the two cases.
Otherwise, the people were as healthy as one can be
on an average of 1½<em>d.</em> a day. Most of them went
back to their own villages in the evening. For
those who lived too far away tiny huts or coverts of
bamboo frames thatched with straw were provided.
When the dams were finished, they were to be
“departmentally watched and maintained.”</p>

<p>When I saw Sir John Hewett a short time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
afterwards at Agra, he told me he had over 150,000
workers on the relief works, and over 310,000
receiving relief of one kind or another. Owing to
the famine the yield of grain in his province was
3,500,000 tons below the normal; rice yielded only
a quarter of the average; and £4,000,000 had been
lost on the sugar and cotton crops combined. To
meet the scarcity, Government had already suspended
120 lakhs (£800,000) of land revenue, a
large part of which would be permanently remitted,
and had advanced about £1,000,000 for relief, the
purchase of seed, and sinking of temporary wells.
Speaking at Lucknow a few days later (January
25, 1908) Sir John Hewett said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“These measures have given heart to the people, provided
occupation in the villages at remunerative rates of wages,
and prevented the occurrence of crime. The people themselves
have met the crisis in the most commendable spirit.
Never was there a famine in which the people and the
Government and its officers showed a more united front
than the present one. The ryots have toiled early and late
to prepare and sow their fields for the spring harvest, and
they have not toiled in vain.”</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">That speech was made, however, after blessed rain
had fallen. When I was at Agra, one inch of rain
suddenly fell in one night, and I shall not forget
the joyful change upon the faces of the officials. It
must be remembered also that, excellent as the
administration of the famine relief was, and fully as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
the Lieutenant-Governor deserves his popularity,
the United Provinces is probably a district all the
easier to govern just because it is comparatively
backward, and out of its population of nearly
50,000,000 about 70 per cent. are directly dependent
upon agriculture for their living.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In his Financial Statement to the Viceroy’s
Council (March 20, 1908), Mr. E. N. Baker,
now Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, calculated that
the famine of the year had affected an area with a
population of about 49 millions. It had raised the
price of wheat so high that the export from India had
almost wholly stopped, while the Burma rice crop
had been diverted to India to take the place of what
was lost. He estimated the amount of takavi
advances, or village loans for wells, seed, etc., for
the preceding and present years together at 4 crores
of rupees (about £2,650,000), and the amount of
revenue suspended for the two years at nearly 360
lakhs (nearly £2,400,000), of which a large proportion
must be permanently remitted. The total loss
to the State by loss of revenue and increase of
expenditure combined he estimated at 985 lakhs
(about £6,633,000) for the two years. He added
the significant comment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The distress caused by high prices has undoubtedly
affected all classes, and has pressed with great severity on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
the urban populations, and on all who are dependent on
small fixed incomes. But the more painful conditions which
we associate with widespread famine in India—the emaciation,
the aimless wandering, the disruption of social ties, and
the increase of crime—are as yet so rare and exceptional as
to be scarcely noticeable. The energy and determination
with which the people have themselves faced the calamity
have been observed on all hands, and we may reasonably
hope that if the coming season is favourable the progress of
the country will resume its normal course, without any such
check as a famine on a similar scale would have caused in
bygone times.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That sounds fairly simple, and, of course, its
hopefulness was justified; but the whole question
of the famine brought one up short against problems
that may be common to all countries, but are perhaps
more difficult in India, because under our rule
the economic stages are becoming mixed together.
What Mr. Baker, for instance, says about the
pressure upon urban populations and small fixed
incomes owing to the famine is true; but then the
pressure appears to be permanent, famine or no
famine. The rise in price of ordinary provisions
seems to be continuous and general. I heard the
same complaint in the Deccan, in Eastern Bengal,
Calcutta, Benares, Allahabad, Delhi, and Lahore.
Within twenty years wages may have doubled, but
the cost of common food has quadrupled. In
Bengal, for example, Mr. Chunder Nath Bose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Fellow of the Calcutta University, who knew the
prices as a boy, says they have gone up fourfold or
even tenfold for the staples of Bengal diet, such as
rice, wheat, potatoes, brinjal, dal, fish, and, what is
worst, for milk and ghi (clarified butter).<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Many
explanations were given me by English and Indian
alike—the export of grain, the growth of jute, the
fixing of the rupee, the increased circulation of
rupees before 1893, and the transition from payment
in kind to payment in cash. Some of these explanations
are contradictory, and all of them have been
vehemently contradicted. But as to the result, there
appeared to be no doubt: life is becoming harder
for all working people, especially for all workers on
fixed incomes, and the only people who do not
notice the increasing burden are the few with
“rapidly expanding business” and those who could
not possibly eat up to their incomes if they tried.</p>

<p>It was still more difficult to discover the real
condition of the peasants and labourers in the
country compared to the workpeople in the towns.
In villages near the relief works, the cultivators
(ryots) told me they paid sometimes one and sometimes
ten rupees a bigha (rather over half an acre)
to the zemindar, but their average rent appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
be about two rupees a bigha (say 5<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> an acre).
Some said they thought they made or saved ten or
even twenty rupees a year for marriages, births,
funerals, ceremonies, and pilgrimages. But nearly
all of them said they saved nothing. They admitted,
however, that for a daughter’s marriage a ryot would
sometimes spend as much as two hundred rupees,
borrowed from the zemindar or banya (money-lender),
and when I asked one of them what he
borrowed on if he had no savings, he replied that
he borrowed on his “respectability,” which is, I
suppose, what most people borrow on. At the back
of the borrower’s mind, I think, is the continual
hope for a “bumper” crop that will start him free
again, but as the rate of interest without solid
security was anything from 25 to 36 per cent. both
here and in the Punjab, the ryot often became little
more than a labourer in the employment of the
money-lender, who advanced him seed and stock
and took the crop. In a village outside Lahore I
found the cultivators had agreed among themselves
not to spend money on marriages in future, though
these village festivals had been their only joy, and
now, unless a juggler or reciter came round, they
had nothing whatever to break the monotony of toil
upon the land—not even a school. Neither were
there any schools in the villages I visited near
Allahabad, nor in those near Delhi.</p>

<p>But though in many cases the ryot had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
little better than a labourer in the employment of
a landowner or money-lender, there was still a
recognized class of landless labourers below him.
In the villages near the relief works the labourer
(who is always paid in kind) got 2½ lbs. of grain
for a day’s work from dawn to dark with two hours
off, and he could count on work most of the year
if the rains were good. He also received one pair
of shoes, one cloth, and ground for his hut, which
he built himself. Some of the labourers told me
of a further gift of three rupees a year (4<em>s.</em>) which
seemed to be a kind of Christmas-box. If the wife
worked she got 1⅛ lb. of grain a day. Turned into
money, at the village price of grain, the labourer’s
wage would thus be about 2<em>d.</em> a day, apart from
his wife’s earnings (say 1<em>d.</em>) and the extras I have
mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Beside the money-lender, the landowner, the
cultivator, and the labourer, I found in every village
one or two artisans, though the division of industry
was not exact, and some of the artisans did a little
agriculture as well. Nearly all villages seem to
have a barber, a potter, a carpenter, “sweepers”
or scavengers, and one or two priestly families to
perform the common rites that mankind wants, to
bless the harvest, foretell the weather, and control
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>the local ghosts. In some villages I also found the
hand-loom weaver, and in a Mohammedan village
near Lahore the weaver told me he could make ten
yards a day, which he valued at five annas, his wife
spinning the yarn by walking to and fro as on a
rope-walk. In the same village the carpenter was
specially employed on making water-wheels. But
the village artisans, as a rule, are not paid by the
job but are allowed a fairly regular income by the
village, each family contributing so many measures
of grain at each of the two harvests for their support.
For instance, the village priest gets about 5 lb. of
grain per plough at harvest, but the potter gets
20 lb. per plough and the carpenter 50 lb.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>As far as mere money-value goes, it is not very
hard to compare the earnings of village labourers
and artisans with the earnings of workpeople in the
towns. In the eighty or ninety cotton mills of
Bombay, for instance, the average man’s wages are
18 rupees a month, or a little over 10<em>d.</em> a day; a
woman’s highest wage is a fraction under 7<em>d.</em> a day,
and half-time children, nominally over nine years
old and under fourteen, get 2¾<em>d.</em> a day, which is
more than the average labourer’s wage in the village.
At a mill in Delhi I found the wages were less—12
rupees a month instead of 18 for men, and 6<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
rupees instead of 8 for boys; but the hours of
labour were twelve with one hour off instead of
thirteen with (nominally) only half an hour off.
In reality, I think it would be quite impossible to
get Indians to do what Lancashire people would
call work for twelve or thirteen hours at a stretch,
with only those little breaks. At all events, it is
not done.</p>

<p>By the measure of money, then, the Bombay
mill-hand would seem to be about five times better
off than the village labourer of the United Provinces.
In so far as most people enjoy living in swarms
rather than in isolation, he is better off; but otherwise
the lot of both is perhaps almost equally
unenviable. The hours in a Bombay mill are spent
in monotonous labour, among hideous noise, and in
a fluffy atmosphere, where there are no fans to
decrease the dust, the heat, or the smell. All
round the factories, workmen’s dwellings, or
“chawls,” have sprung up, usually in galleries of
single rooms along the first floor above a row of
open shops. The average rent is one rupee (1<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>)
a week for a room, and the whole family lives in one
room, in which, as a rule, there is no window but
the door. Most families are saved a lot of dusting
and breakages by having no furniture except a metal
cooking-pot for the rice and dal—a sort of split pea.
These are cooked in cocoanut oil, and form the
almost invariable food, though in one black hole I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>did see a woman cooking something that smelt like
the ghost of a fish, and sometimes a family launched
out into a maize pancake. In one or two rooms
there were real decorations—portraits of Rama,
of Krishna, or the King—and for a week every
doorway was hung with a string of dry leaves,
ears of rice, and little crimson flowers like knapweed,
in memory, I suppose, of some old village
festival. All night long, under a waning moon,
the mill hands sat in the verandahs of these
wretched homes, beating drums, and chanting their
barbaric scales—“praising God,” as they said when
we asked them; but what form of God, or for
what reason they praised Him, they could not
explain.</p>

<p>Villagers, of course, retained the usual advantages
of country life—fresh air, purer food, and greater
bodily freedom and variety in labour. But the
inner conditions of life were otherwise much the
same. In furniture, even the fairly well-to-do
cultivators seldom went beyond a fireplace (usually
outside), a grain store, a plank bed, some rags, some
brass pots and dishes, and in rare cases a few silver
ornaments on the legs and arms of the women as the
most convenient bank. All necessary architecture,
even in mud hovels, is beautiful, and so are all
implements for human use, but I never saw any
attempt at decoration or conscious beauty. It would
be absurd to call the Indian peasants ignorant, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
they understand their own business quite as well as
we understand ours, and in their own knowledge
they have little to learn. But in most villages the
isolation and absence of schools make them unnecessarily
superstitious and apprehensive of unreal
dangers. Almost within sight of Lahore, the women
rushed away to the flat roof-tops with their children
for fear I should blight their souls, and the men
could not imagine what I might be, except a
revenue collector, a pill doctor, or an official come
to poison the wells with plague. Near Delhi the
women turned their faces sharply to the wall at my
shadow, and lived in perpetual terror of “soldiers,”
though for no definite reason. At the foot of the
Himalaya up from Hardwar, no one in the village
had heard of the Viceroy, or of the Congress, or of
Lajpat Rai, though it was little more than twenty-four
hours’ journey from Lahore. Only one man
knew what a newspaper was, or had ever seen one,
and neither he nor any one else could have read a
word of it. One old man said he knew they were
governed by England, but he had no notion what
sort of a thing England was. Another old man in
a village within ten miles of Delhi told me that,
although he knew nothing about England, he was
grateful to the English because when he was a boy
his grandfather used to tell him of horrible murders
and lootings, but there were hardly any of such
terrors now. And as that was one of the few nice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>things I heard about ourselves in India, I will
conclude with it.</p>

<p>But the central problems remain untouched—the
problems of the famines, the rise in prices, and of
the poverty, which is probably increasing. Is the
rainfall permanently growing less, and, if so, have
the alterations in the Nile anything to do with it?
Is the distress more terrible because the cultivators
sell their grain, largely for export, instead of hoarding
some proportion of it? Or is it true that they ever
hoarded it? Is it want of money rather than want
of grain that is bringing ruin on the people? All
these things are said.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But I would point out one
simple and obvious thing about the famine district
that I visited in the United Provinces. The land
there by its direct and immediate yield was expected
to support, in the first place, the Government, with
its expensive army and civil service; in the second
place, the landowners (zemindars) who usually did
the same kind of work as our landowners at home—collecting
rents; in the third place, the farmers
(ryots), who sold the crops, paid the rent, and
worked themselves when poverty compelled them;
in the fourth place, the labourers, who worked in
good years and starved in bad; in the fifth place, the
artisans, who worked for civilization and decency;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
in the sixth place, the priests, who worked for
religion and the soul; and in the seventh place,
the money-lenders, who scooped up an interest of
about 30 per cent. when they could get it. Patient
as this old earth is, it seems to me that in parts of
India her patience is a little overburdened.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">The Arya Samaj</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It was evening service, at the hour when sunset is
still bright, but if you stare into the sky, you
suddenly see the stars. A few score of boys and
young men were gathered round a small square pit,
in which a fire of dry sticks was burning with a
yellow flame. They were dressed in long cotton
cloths of yellow or white, and, sitting in rows, they
chanted the ancient Vedic hymns in praise of God,
with the peculiar intervals and nasal quaverings of
the East. In their midst, by the edge of the pit,
sat their Guru, or teacher, and from time to time he
ladled clarified butter into the fire, while youths from
each of the other sides of the square threw in handfuls
of rice and fragrant woods or herbs. Meantime
the chanting never ceased, but with a concentrated
vehemence all raised to the air the eternal Sanscrit
words, revealed to the Aryan race before recorded
history, so that they might never be devoid of
the holiest wisdom, but bear it with them across
mountains of ice and over sunburnt plains to the
furthest world. At the end, all stood up for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
final evening hymn, and then dispersed, leaving
the fire burning as a symbol of man’s soul, and of
the divine power, and of the transfiguration of the
spirit by flame and purity.</p>

<p>That form of worship is celebrated every morning
and evening by all Vedic believers, whether
assembled or alone. But I saw it first at one of the
students’ homes in Lahore, where a branch of the Arya
Samaj, or Aryan Society, has a school and an “Anglo-Vedic
College,” numbering about 1800 members
together. Lala Lajpat Rai sat next me, for it was
to this branch that he had devoted all his labours
for social and religious reform, till injustice drove
him to turn aside into politics from the true objects
of the Samaj. I speak of a branch because, like
most vital movements, the Samaj is divided into
parties, one holding its services inside the crowded
old city itself, the other just outside the ancient
walls. As usually happens, the two parties in the
religion have split on unessential points, for which
they are prepared to die, though not to kill. But
both claim to follow the doctrines of their founder,
Dayananda Saraswati, who quitted this stage of
existence at Ajmere in 1883, after a wandering life
of holy poverty given up entirely to the denunciation
of idols, caste restrictions, animal sacrifices,
licentious rites, the multiplicity of deities, and other
accretions with which frail humanity has surrounded
the stern purity of the Vedic revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Leaving his home as an outcast rather than
submit to the carnal marriage tie, Dayananda spent
sixteen years of youth and early manhood in walking
from one holy place of Northern India to another.
Sometimes he passed into Kashmir, thrice he crossed
the snow mountains into Thibet, and, hungry for
wisdom, he sought everywhere for the teacher at
whose feet he might enjoy it. At last he found
wisdom near at hand, in those very scriptures on
which he had meditated day and night, and full of
reforming zeal he turned to Benares and other seats
of religious learning where he might confute the
Pundits, whose obscure minds darkened the hard
radiance of God’s Sanscrit word. In city after city
public debates were held before immense audiences,
Dayananda in solitary knowledge opposing the
priestly hostility of all the teachers combined, while
as a rule, the local representative of the British
Empire was invited to take the chair and see fair
play, or award the prize in subtleties of theological
controversy. The latter was a task for which our
public-school education does not specially adapt us,
but as a rule the British representative was spared
the difficulty of metaphysical decision by the Pundits
themselves, who violently broke up the meeting
under consciousness of defeat. Perhaps unhappily
for his cause, Dayananda did not confine himself to
the purgation of Hindu superstitions and social
abuses, but was equally vehement in his attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
upon the unworthy additions and compromises that
have gathered round Christianity and Islam; and
to his success in interrupting the process of conversion
among Hindus we may trace the marked
hostility with which Christian and Mohammedan
missionaries have always regarded the Samaj.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The first branch of the society was established
in Bombay by Dayananda himself in 1875, but its
real strength now lies in the Punjab and United
Provinces, in both of which together it numbers
about 250,000 members. The two parties into
which the Samaj in Lahore is to some extent divided,
as I said, both unite in rejecting idols, and in condemning
the seclusion or “purdah” of women, the
dangerous prerogatives of the priesthood, and all
restrictions of caste, except such rights and obligations
as are the due of character or intellect. Both
unite in maintaining the unity of God, the eternal
trinity of God, Soul, and Matter, and the universal
wisdom revealed for all races in the Vedas. The
differences that divide them are, perhaps, rather of
temperament than of doctrine. The party that
worships in the city claims to be more democratic
in its appeal, to be stricter in life and discipline, but
at the same time freer from “purdah”; and, indeed,
its women are allowed to attend divine service in a
gallery unveiled, while the women of the other party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
have a service to themselves, with a woman preacher,
whose sermons I was, unhappily, unable to attend.
The city party has been called the Culture Section,
in which name, I think, there lies a covert sneer.
But it briskly retaliated by calling the suburban
party the Vulture Section, in which the sneer is not
covert at all, but palpably due to a backsliding from
vegetarianism.</p>

<p>Not that the extra-mural party itself dreams of
backsliding. It only aims at progress and increasing
freedom in social life; for, like other great movements
of religious reform, it maintains that the
kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink. The
differences, in fact, have never been serious, though
a few years ago there was the same tender hostility
as used to prevail between Newton Hall and Lamb’s
Conduit Street, when Positivists turned their
criticism from Christians to each other. But of
late persecution, which makes all its victims friends,
has brought them together again, and few of the
outside world are now aware of any division. It
was the deportation of Lajpat Rai that gave the
final touch to reconcilement. That a man of austere
and generous life, one who had given up great
worldly success for the service of the poor and
unlearned, should be spirited away without warning
and without trial for venturing to criticize official
injustice—that was the touch to kindle the indignant
fire which welds men into one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>Lajpat Rai was one of those men into whose
soul the wrongs of their people enter. By nature
averse from politics, he devoted himself to those
deeper questions which lie beyond the touch of
governments good or bad, and it was not till he was
forty that the decisive change came. It is true that
he joined the Congress movement in 1888, within
two or three years of its beginning; but no one
has more severely criticized the Congress and its
methods—its unwieldy size, its holiday aspect, its
failure to touch the poverty and ignorance of India,
and its mistaken confidence in the power of speeches
and resolutions for the redress of political wrongs.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>It was significant of his strength of character and
indifference to popularity, that after the breach in
the Surat Congress, he gave his immense influence
to the Moderate party, and declared he would fight
under the old banner, as I have described. But it
was still more characteristic that, when the Congress
had vanished, he remained in Surat for the Social
and Swadeshi Conferences, and organized a famine-relief
fund there, just as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Deeper things than can be reached by Government
or speeches have occupied his life. Born at
Jaguran, in the district of Ludhiana, where his
father taught Persian and Urdu, he became a student
at the Government College in Lahore, and a Pleader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>in the Courts there just at the time when the Arya
Samaj was engaged in its earliest struggle for
religious and social reform.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Hans Raj, now the
Principal of the Anglo-Vedic College, a direct and
silent man of similar austerity and devotion of life,
he joined the Samaj and threw himself into its
conflict against idol-worship, child-marriage, girl-widowhood,
caste subdivisions, and the other abuses
of orthodox Hinduism. Poverty, ignorance, and
famine appeared to him the chief outward and
visible evils of his country, and for many years, in
the intervals of heavy professional work, he lived
the life of what one would call a philanthropist,
if the word had not gathered round it the inhuman
associations of charity. He directed orphanages,
superintended education, helped to found Swadeshi
banks and mills long before Swadeshi became a
political weapon; he administered famine funds—with
a side-glance at the unhappy “famine Christians,”
the Samajists say he rescued thousands of
souls from famine and conversion—and one of his
great achievements was the relief of the destitute in
the Kangra valley after the terrible earthquake of
1905.</p>

<p>But I think that year marked a change. So far,
beyond attending the Congress and publishing two
vernacular pamphlets on Mazzini and Garibaldi—dangerous
themes, I admit, for a member of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
subject race—his action had not been political. In
that year he went to England, like Mr. Gokhale, to
represent the cause of Indian reform, and he also
visited America. It so happened that he found
England on the verge of the greatest Liberal revival.
She appeared to have awakened from the ten years’
incubus of reaction and Imperialistic misgovernment.
Hopes of reform went hand in hand with hatred of
oppression. He noticed the movements of the
unemployed, the devotion of passive resisters, the
sympathies with oppressed nationalities, the rapid
recovery from the fever of the Boer war. He
noticed that even on such a question as bringing the
trams across the bridges the Lords were threatened
with a revolution in the ordering of the State.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The same spirit of freedom appeared to be at work
in other parts of the world—in Ireland, Japan,
Egypt, Persia, and especially in Russia. It was
natural that the ideal of winning for his own people
a true share in the government of their country
should be strengthened.</p>

<p>Unhappily, Lajpat Rai also observed in England
that the people were too much occupied with the
overwhelming problems confronting themselves to
pay close attention to a subject so distant and
abstruse as Indian reform. He observed that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
English politics the cause of justice had no chance
unless it were made a party question, and the
Liberal Party refused to make Indian reform a party
question, because, while it did not move the people
at large, it touched too many important interests.
As to the upper classes, he found, as Ruskin had
found long before, that “every mutiny, every danger,
every crime occurring under our Indian legislation
arose directly out of our native desire to live on
the loot of India.” Only from the Irish and Labour
Parties did his mission receive any real encouragement,
and, owing to the executive weakness of those
two parties, he concluded—one may still hope too
hastily—that any appeal to the justice and benevolence
of Great Britain as represented by her
Parliament was vain:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“You can at times,” he wrote, “successfully appeal to
the humanity and benevolence of individuals, but to hope
for justice and benevolence from a nation is hoping against
hope. The rule of a foreign democracy is, in this respect
the most dangerous. The democracy is swayed by so many
diverse interests that it is impossible to expect anything like
unanimity or even a preponderance of opinion in dealing
justly with a subject race, because justice to a subject race
often clashes with the interest of some class of the ruling
democracy. Whenever an attempt is made to do justice to
the subject race, that class rises up, raises a storm, and
prevents the Government from doing the right thing. Look
at the history of the cotton duties in India, and every one
will see the truth of this. How many times has the Government
of India been overruled in the matter, simply because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
the Home Government cannot afford to risk the opposition
of Lancashire and incur its displeasure!”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He returned to India convinced that the political
as well as the social salvation of the country rested
only with the Indian peoples themselves. As to
means, he looked to anything that would promote
political knowledge, courage, and self-reliance. At
one time he seems to have contemplated a kind of
Teaching Order, something like Mr. Gokhale’s
“Servants of India.”</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Where are the political thinkers of the country,” he
cried, “whose sole thought by day and night, sleeping or
waking, would be how to initiate and carry on the struggle
for freedom? Where are the political Sanyasis (wandering
friars) whose sole work in life would be the preaching of
the gospel of freedom? Were are the Vaishyas of the
movement who will make money only for the struggle:
who will live poorly and modestly and save every farthing
for the sacred cause?... Where are the people who will
raise agitation for political rights and liberty to the dignity
of a Church and will live and die for the same?”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He believed that the only way to win the
consideration of England for reforms was to prove
the determination and self-reliance of the Indians
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“The British are not a spiritual people,” he said. “They
are either a fighting race or a commercial nation. It would
be throwing pearls before swine to appeal to them in the
name of the higher morality or justice or on ethical grounds.
They are a self-reliant, haughty people, who can appreciate
self-respect and self-reliance even in their opponents.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In a yielding disposition, a false prudence, a
distrust of enthusiasm and energy, he found the
real dangers of the Indian temperament.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Our whole life from top to bottom smacks of fear,”
he wrote, “deadly fear of losing in the estimation of those
whom we in our heart of hearts believe to be only usurpers;
fear of losing the sunshine of the smile of those whom we
believe to be day and night engaged in the exploitation of
our country and the spoliation of our people, fear of offending
the false gods that have by fraud or force taken possessions
of our bodies and souls, fear of being shut up in a dungeon
or prison house, as if the freedom that we enjoy were not by
its own nature one to be abhorred.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He was soon in his own person to prove the
sincerity of his creed. The condition of the Punjab
during 1907 was particularly deplorable. For
thirteen years scarcity had prevailed almost without
intermission in the south of the province, and the
increasing poverty was only relieved by the hideous
mortality of the plague. Just before Lajpat Rai’s
deportation, the official record of deaths from plague
in the Punjab alone rose to nearly 65,000 in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
week, and the real number was almost certainly
higher. On the top of hunger and plague, which
we piously call the visitations of God, came the
visitations of the Government in a largely increased
revenue assessment, increased irrigation rates, the
Colonization Bill threatening to break a solemn
promise made by Government to the Chenab
settlers fifteen years before, and the refusal of the
Lieutenant-Governor to take any steps against the
leading Anglo-Indian paper of Lahore for a series of
abusive articles against Indians, whilst Indian papers
were prosecuted and condemned for articles containing
certainly no greater incitement to racial
animosity.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The feeling in the Punjab became
intensely embittered. Local riots occurred at
Lahore and Rawal Pindi. Anglo-Indian journalists
remembered that it was the fiftieth anniversary of
the Mutiny. Strange precautions were taken.
English people took refuge in the forts. In the
haggard element of fear anything may assume a
terrifying shape, and without trial or charge or
warning, the most prominent member of the Arya
Samaj was seized, and sent to Mandalay.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>It was all a little ironic, this treatment of a sad,
retiring, clear-minded man, seeking neither advantage
nor fame—one who had freely given up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
possessions, and worked for many years unknown
at the humblest duties. When I was at Peshawar,
I ventured to ask one in authority why a man of such
high reputation as Lajpat Rai should have been
selected for attack, and in defence of the Punjab
Government, he said: “You see, it was just because
he was so good that they fired him. If he had
been a rotter, they could have left him alone.” I
think it was as fine a compliment as any political
offender could hope for.</p>

<p>But it was not entirely for his personal excellence
that the Punjab Government struck at Lajpat Rai,
nor for the wide influence of his decisive eloquence.
It was because they hoped to strike the Arya Samaj
at the same time. The authorities in Northern
India, always timid and suspicious owing to the
neighbourhood of the Frontier and the more warlike
character of the peoples, had long regarded the
Samaj with special enmity. I have known a soldier,
with papers of the highest character, turned out of a
Sikh regiment admittedly for belonging to the Samaj.
Much of this suspicion arises from false information,
such as is always supplied to officials who remain
isolated from the surrounding people. The editor
of the <cite>Hindustan</cite>, for instance, who had recently
been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, was
described as a graduate of the Anglo-Vedic College,
though he had hardly been there a month, and owed
the rest of his training to a Christian Mission School.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
In the same way young Ajit Singh, who was deported
on suspicion of tampering with the native troops,
was described as a prominent Samajist, though he
had never belonged to the Samaj at all. Some
members of the Society have turned to politics,
because for the moment the attraction is irresistible
for many generous minds, and at such a time, as
Disraeli said in “Sybil,” “to be young and to be
indifferent are no longer synonymous.” But the
Samaj as such has no concern with politics.</p>

<p>It is a religious body—a Universal Church—bent
only on religious purification and the training
of youth in accordance with Vedic rules. One can
understand the opposition of orthodox Hindus,
Mohammedans, and Christian missionaries, for in
its religious propaganda the Samaj is distinctly militant
and gathers in many converts. But the Indian
Government is mistaken in regarding it as a centre
of sedition. The leaders of both sections—such
men as Hans Raj, Principal of the Anglo-Vedic
College in Lahore, and Lala Munshi Rama, Governor
of the Gurukula, near Hardwar—have steadily set
their faces against political work of any sort, and
they discourage political discussion among the
students as strictly as the Risley Circular. It is
useless, they say, to look for the political regeneration
of India while the character and intellect of the
people are unregenerate. I do not agree with them,
believing, as I do, that political freedom is essential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>for any regeneration of the national spirit. But to
accuse the Samaj of political aims, to grasp at any
forgery or lie which seeks to implicate the Society
in sedition, are only signs of ignorance fixed in its
isolation among a subject race. In the summer of
1907, Lala Munshi Rama wrote a detailed defence
of the Samaj on this point in the <cite>Civil and Military
Gazette</cite> of Lahore—a defence so just and reasonable
that even the <cite>Gazette</cite>, conspicuous among Anglo-Indian
papers for the virulence of its anti-Indian
feeling, described the “dignity of this deeply
pondered vindication” as commanding respect. In
one passage he said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“It is an awful responsibility which these people undertake
who try to set the Government against the Arya
Samaj, a Society which is trying its best to uproot some
of the evils of intemperance, of impurity, of child-marriage,
of polygamy, of gambling, and a host of other vices—why,
it is the Arya Samajists whom you find in the foremost
rank of workers in the field.”</p>
</div>

<p>Six or seven years ago—in 1901 or early 1902—the
writer of that protest cleared a large open
space in a pleasant jungle where in a single day I
have still seen many deer and monkeys, many wild
boars and jackals, the bone-strewn home of a tigress
with cubs, the spoor of a huge elephant, wild peacocks
perching in the trees, and nearly all the other
delights of Eden, except Eve. A few miles away
the holy Ganges issues from the foot of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
Himalayas into the great Indian plain, and there stands
the holy town of Hardwar, goal of great pilgrimages
and pitch of many religious beggars, who keep with
them deformed cows and other holy monsters to
move the hearts of worshippers to pity. On the
open space in the jungle a quadrangle of tin-roofed
buildings has been raised to be a Vedic school and
future college. Over its gateway floats a red banner,
inscribed with the sacred symbol of “Om,” and its
Brahmacharya, or holy discipline, follows the lines
laid down by primeval revelation.</p>

<p>Those lines are Spartan, or, at least, Platonic.
The boys are admitted at eight, and their parents
take a solemn pledge not to remove them or allow
their marriage till they are twenty-five, the lowest
age fixed for a man’s marriage by the Vedic Scriptures.
During these sixteen years the Brahmacharies,
or disciples, do not go home, nor are they
allowed to write letters or receive them; but their
parents may visit them once a month, and do, in
fact, visit them about twice a year. The great
occasion for these visits is the school anniversary,
which happens to be St. Patrick’s Day, when over
sixty thousand Samajists come, including many
thousands of women, and encamp on the edge of
the jungle in grass and wicker huts, which were
being prepared for them during my stay in the
school. Unlike the parents who come to see their
sons on speech-days at our public-schools, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>pilgrim visitors bring their own supplies, and they
generally stay three days, that being all of family
life the boys ever know. And that is all they
know of woman’s society, too, for it is, as I said,
an Eveless Paradise.</p>

<p>Such isolation in the midst of our common and
intermingled world is, perhaps, dangerous. It comes
too near the inhuman monotony of workhouse
schools. It is likely to exaggerate the desires and
curiosity of growing men, or to produce the hesitation
of bashful and secluded lives when confronted
with the need for action. The entire removal of
home influence might appear harsh if we did not
remember the scores of men whom we have known
ruined by their parents’ vulgarity or their mothers’
indulgence. But even if we grant that most parents
are quite unfit to bring up children, sixteen years
seems too long for any boy to remain in the same
place, with the same teachers and the same companions.
Even the holiday excursions to historic
cities of India, which are arranged by the Governor,
and usually conducted by him, do not sufficiently
break up the one-sidedness of such a life; and think
of the boy who is genuinely unfitted for school and
is compelled to remain unhappy for a quarter of
man’s existence!</p>

<p>Mr. Rama Deva, the young and highly educated
head-master of the school, and the other masters as
well, met my scruples by urging that in India the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
home influence is almost invariably dangerous or
softening. They said their only hope of preserving
the boys from child-marriage, maternal ignorance,
and the evil of cities lay in this monastic seclusion.
In place of parents they have a few Superintendents—about
one to every twenty-five of the 220 boys
then in the school—who live with each class day and
night, except during school hours. The greatest
difficulty of the school is to find Superintendents
worthy and willing, and I should have thought it
impossible. The three oldest boys in the top form
have rooms to themselves and no Superintendent.
All sleep on plank beds, but are allowed a warm
covering in winter. All dress in yellow “dhotis”
(long cotton cloths) for schooltime, and in white
“dhotis” for play. They are allowed wooden
sandals, held on by a peg between the toes, but
nearly all go barefoot, and with feet and legs bare
they ride bareback and play cricket, football, and an
Indian form of prisoners’ base. The school belongs
to the Culture Section of the Arya Samaj, and is so
violently vegetarian that I was not allowed to
approach the buildings in boots of murdered leather.</p>

<p>The boys get up at four in the morning, and
attend Divine service round the symbolic fire.
Having taken the vows of obedience, poverty, and
chastity for sixteen years at their entrance, when two
of those vows can mean very little to them, they
are further taught to speak the truth, to practise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
concentrated contemplation for a period of every
day, and to subdue passion by the “yoga” of deep
breathing and holding the breath. They bathe in
cold water before sunrise, they climb the steep
jungle mountains near, and all learn swimming in
the Ganges. Almost the only form of punishment
is exclusion from the games. The school hours run
to about seven, divided into two parts, and the chief
subject taught is Sanscrit. There are the other
ordinary subjects—arithmetic and mathematics,
history, science, and English—and, unlike the
Government schools, all teaching is given in the
vernacular Hindi, so that the boys understand
the subjects better, and can cover more ground,
whereas in ordinary schools the learning is continually
hampered by the foreign tongue. But the
chief means of education is Sanscrit, just as in my
old school it was Greek. At least seven years are
spent in getting that amazing Sanscrit grammar off
by heart, and in learning to read the Vedas.
Whether the Sanscrit literature is worth all that, I
cannot say; we spent much the same time over
Greek, and it was well worth it to about one in
twenty. But in all the upper forms, though none
of the boys had yet approached the full age, they
could already read and write Sanscrit as fluently as a
mother tongue, and that is more than any of us ever
did with Greek.</p>

<p>But the subject taught never matters much.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
The thing that does matter is the manner of
teaching, and nearly all the schools and colleges I
visited in India had the one common fault, that they
tried to force knowledge into the mind by giving
information. They treated the mind as a passive
vessel to be filled through the channel of the ears.
The method was by lecture, not by dialectic, and
I at least have never learnt anything by being
lectured. If the officials wish to reform our system
of education in India, here, at the very basis of
teaching, is where they might begin. They will
find they are far too late if they hope to stifle the
national aspiration for liberty by excluding the study
of our own history and the works of Western
thinkers. Those are plants that we ourselves have
generously set in India, and they are too deep-rooted
to be pulled up now. But to transform the
ordinary teaching into real education would be a
change indeed.</p>

<p>The Gurukula (the word means The Master’s
Home) that I have been describing takes no Government
grant, and submits to no Government inspection;
nor is it affiliated to a Government University,
like the Anglo-Vedic College in Lahore. In the
boarding houses of the Anglo-Vedic School and
College a pupil’s total expenses come to 20 or 25
rupees a month. In the Gurukula the parents pay
10 rupees a month (£8 a year) for the complete
education, including clothes, food, games, and all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>But the cost for each boy is really about £15 a year,
and the deficit is made up by the subscriptions of
the Samajists. Fifteen pounds a year is a great deal
for a poverty-stricken country like India, but I wish
our public schools did not cost ten times as much.
In the great Government school and college for
Mohammedans at Aligarh the Principal told me the
parents paid from 20 to 40 rupees a month according
to the boy’s room (£16 to £32 a year). But that
is a home of luxury, and I believe the money
required to keep a son there often amounts to £45
or even £50 a year, as much as a third of the
payment at one of our own public schools.</p>

<span class="smcap fs80">A Festival of Spring</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The mango trees were all in bloom, and the air full
of their smell. It has just the touch of turpentine
in it that makes the mango fruit so pleasant, and is
so refreshing in an English room that has been
spring-cleaned with furniture polish. The mango
bloom is the Indian “may,”—the sign that spring
has come indeed, and that was why all the great
Sirdars, or landowners, of Baroda were gathered in
the palace hall at nine o’clock one morning, and sat
in thick rows of white-clad figures, with Mahratta
turbans of red and gold on their heads, and curved
swords glittering across their knees. The Maharajah
had summoned them in durbar, to celebrate the
festival of Vasantha, or the Spring, and on the inlaid
pavement below their seats a nautch-girl from Madras
danced without ceasing, to the inspiriting noise of
three or four pipes and a little drum. All the instruments
sounded their peculiar notes together, but
apparently with random independence, though the
girl seemed to know what varied emotions they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
would express. For she danced forward with gestures
that she felt to be suited to some imperceptible
motive, her jewels flashing, and the heavy gold of
her sash swinging over her knees. Then, having
reached her limit of advance towards the empty
throne, she walked quietly backwards, softly clapping
her little brown hands to some imperceptible
time.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the palace garden came the sound
of the tiny old guns which the British Government
allows Native Rulers to retain for saluting purposes,
or to batter the mud walls of an occasional village, as
evidence of their regal power. To the roar of this
artillery the Maharajah entered, and, keeping step at
his side, came the British Resident, conspicuous in
civilization’s clothing. Behind them, stiff with scarlet
and gold, stalked the British officers of a regiment
quartered upon the State by the terms of an ancient
treaty. Passing up the pavement between the rows
of Sirdars, the Maharajah took his seat upon the
purple velvet sofa, having the British Resident side
by side upon his right, while the British officers
settled into the topmost chairs, like a patch of
poppies in a daisy field. All the time the pipes and
drum never ceased, and the dancing-girl continued
to advance and retire with various embellishments.</p>

<p>Attendants appeared, bearing garlands and silver
sprinklers, and trim little bunches of flowers tightly
tied up. The heaviest garland was selected for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
British Resident, and he bent his comely head submissively
to receive it on his neck. It was made of
white jasmine, picked out with silver “fairy rain,”
which I have mentioned before as beautifying our
Christmas-trees. He was also presented with a tight
bunch of flowers, and lavishly sprinkled with scent
from the silver vessels. Similar but smaller garlands
were then placed round the necks of the British
officers; similar but smaller bunches were presented
to them, and they were sprinkled with scent, but
less lavishly, as became their inferior position in the
representation of Britain’s might. When the most
junior subaltern had been sprinkled, the Maharajah
and the Resident rose, and the British contingent
marched out of the hall, the garlands flopping
against their thighs, as when of old Greek bulls
went adorned for sacrifice.</p>

<p>So the rulers departed, and again the feeble old
guns did their utmost to voice the honours due to
Imperial grandeur. Then the Maharajah returned
to his sofa, and a sigh of relief appeared to pass
through the hall. I thought I could even hear it
from behind the carved shutters of the gallery,
where ladies stood watching in seclusion, like the
ladies behind the grill of our House of Commons.
The attendants again bore garlands, bouquets, and
sprinklers into the hall. The Maharajah was
garlanded first, and then his son, the heir to the
sofa, who received his honours with a superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
smile that told of Oxford’s contamination. The
most peculiar part of the ceremony came next,
when silver plates were brought in, heaped high
with vermillion powder and with yellow, to represent
the fertilizing dust of flowers in spring, and this
dust was thrown in handfuls over the Maharajah
and his heir, and then over each Sirdar in turn.</p>

<p>Suddenly the white chests of all those loyal
counsellors blazed with patches of scarlet and gamboge,
while pipes and drum pursued their own
wild will, and the dancing-girl danced up seductively.
Then the Maharajah rose, and the whole assembly
followed him from the hall. The climax had been
reached, and the ceremony of spring was over,
except that for the rest of the day the street
boys rejoiced in “all the fun of the fair,” throwing
red and yellow powder over the passers-by. And
if they mixed a little oil with the powder, the
passer-by would recall the flowers that bloom in
the spring whenever he put those clothes on again.</p>

<p>You would suppose that such a ceremony was
but the childish consolation of some wretched prince,
whom we allow to retain on sufferance the pomps
and vanities of barbaric splendour, just as an idiot
heir is allowed a rocking-horse and wooden sword
by his trustees. And that is partly true. It is in
the spirit of interested trustees for idiot children
that the British Government gives the Maharajah
that artillery to play with, and arms his handful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
of troops with ancient muzzle-loaders that I had
despaired of ever seeing in use. An ordinary and
enfeebled ruler might thus solace himself with pretty
shows for a life of miserable impotence, just as
Napoleon’s son played at soldiers in the Austrian
palaces. Such is the end of most of those who are
born to rule our Native States. Fantastic palaces in
every street, marble courts where fountains play all
the summer, bedizened elephants in lordly rows,
bejewelled girls beyond the dreams of Solomon,
studs of horses ceaselessly neighing, changes of
golden clothes for every hour of the day and night,
heaps of golden coins piled high in treasuries, drink
deep as wells, exquisite foods selected from Paris to
Siam—oh, but to be weak is miserable!</p>

<p>But the ruler of Baroda has the strength that
conquers power out of weakness. Brought up
among the temptations of princes, cheated with
the mockeries of authority, distrusted as seditious
for the very excellence of his reforms, he has raised
his little State of some two million souls to become
the most advanced and best administered district of
India, with the possible exception of Mysore. I
know the worst that can be said against him. His
land-tax is rather above the average of British India,
but at all events his entire income of just under
£1,000,000 a year is spent in the country itself, and
does not go to cherish the annuitants in Cheltenham
or Whitehall. Like the English aristocracy, he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
fond of building more houses than one man needs
to live in. Like the late Lord Salisbury and Mr.
Kruger, he displays an exaggerated solicitude in
providing for members of his family, beyond the
requirements of laudable thrift. And, worst fault
of all, he has been sometimes suspected of imitating
the Anglo-Indian authorities in favouring Europeans
at the cost of fully qualified Indians. On one occasion
also, I believe, he conducted a punitive expedition,
on almost British lines, against some troublesome
villagers. I know all this is said, and much of it is
very likely true, for even in a hovel it is difficult to
live above reproach. But I have also heard that in
the foolish Durbar at Delhi, when other native rulers
salaamed and prostrated themselves to earth, the
Maharajah of Baroda went up to Lord Curzon like
a man, and shook him heartily by the hand; and I
think that story as likely to be true as the others.</p>

<p>It is now over twenty-five years since he entered
upon his power, after a few years of tutelage under
the British Government, which had deposed his predecessor
for overstepping the latitude granted to
native rulers in everything but politics. In that
quarter-century, by the help of carefully chosen
Ministers, such as Mr. Romesh Chandra Dutt, he
has realized reforms in government and daily life
that are continually called impossible by ourselves.
Throughout his whole State he has absolutely
separated the judicial from the executive functions—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
reform that we have acknowledged for years to
be essential for India, but are boggling over still.
He has restored the ancient village Panchayat, or
parish council, by the men whom villagers can trust,
whereas, in our passion for rigid and centralized
power, we have almost destroyed the last vestige
of this national training in self-government.</p>

<p>After a careful experiment for fourteen years in
one district, he has now made primary education compulsory
and universal throughout his State. Whereas
in British India the Government expenditure upon
primary education still stood in 1906-7 at about
£200,000, or considerably less than £1 per thousand
of the population, in Baroda the proportion was about
£1 to every fifty-five, and the State counts more
educated girls, for its size, than any other part of
India. The latest step in constitutional reform has
been the admission of genuinely elected members
into the Legislative Council, which was to meet
that year (1908) for the first time in its more
democratic form. Such reforms as the Indian
Government had at that time proposed for its
Legislative Council, were only intended to frustrate
what shadow of democratic principle then existed in
them.</p>

<p>But it is much harder to change a social custom
than to legislate, and the Maharajah’s greatest
triumphs lay in the prevention of child-marriages,
the emancipation of ladies from the “purdah,” or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>curtained life, and the breaking-down of caste
barriers. In all this he had been aided by the
encouragement and example of his Maharani, who
had stood by his side like one of the heroic queens
of Mahratta history. In all India I suppose there
was not another man and woman who had done
more for the happiness and advancement of their
people, or done more to disprove the common
Anglo-Indian charge that Indians are incapable of
carrying out even their own reforms. For their
very success they were suspected and maligned by
officials, who had not the courage to imitate their
methods. But when official torpor and private
malignity had said their worst, the Maharajah and
his queen remained among the royal souls of India.
They had once more established the old Roman
paradox that it is possible to follow virtue even in
a palace, and there was something almost Aurelian
in their proud service to the Commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<span class="smcap fs80">Summary and Conclusion</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Let it be granted, as a matter of bare fact, quite
apart from any wishes or opinions, that for many
years to come we shall retain military and administrative
command in India. Rightly or wrongly, we
shall retain it, unless we are so overwhelmingly
defeated at home that we almost cease to be not
only an empire but a nation. Probably it is to our
own advantage to retain it, because to withdraw
before India is strong enough to stand alone would
degrade our national life with a cowardly sense of
failure. Personally I think it is to India’s advantage
also, because her peoples are so unarmed, undrilled,
and unorganized under our rule that if we withdrew
our place would easily be taken within a year by
Russia, Germany, or Japan; perhaps by all three in
conflict. When the very worst that can be said against
our rule has been said, the substitution of Russia’s
rule for ours would be an incalculable disaster from
which India might recover only after many generations,
just as Poland, the Caucasus, and Persia may.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
Nor have Germany and Japan yet given proof of
governing subject races with success, much less with
humanity. Till India is sufficiently advanced in
arms, unity, and knowledge to hold her own (which
used to be the hope of our statesmen), it is probably
to her advantage that we should retain the ultimate
supremacy in government and war. We may not
do it particularly well, but the chances are that
others would do it incomparably worse. Let it be
granted, anyhow, that nothing but overwhelming
national defeat will deter us from doing it.</p>

<p>But whilst we shall continue, as far as politics
can foresee, to superintend the administration of
India and to protect her from external attack,
the danger is that our bureaucracy, always the
slowest form of government to realize change, should
ignore the new spirit arising in the country, or
should seek to stifle rather than guide it. It is the
conviction of many that India is now standing on
the verge of a national renaissance—a new birth in
intellect, social life, and the affairs of state. There
are unmistakable evidences of this, not only among
educated Hindus, but among educated Mohammedans;
not only among the educated classes, but
throughout the masses of the people. Many things
have combined to create a new spirit, and we have
ourselves contributed much. The long peace that
has made development possible, the easy communication
by railways, the wide distribution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
newspapers, the visits of highly educated Indians to
England, the use of English as a common tongue
among educated people of all races and religions, the
increasing knowledge of our history and our hard-won
liberties, the increasing study of our great
Liberal thinkers—all these admirable advantages we
have ourselves contributed to the new spirit, and
it is useless for startled reactionaries to think of
withdrawing them now. We must also take into
account the example set to all Oriental nationalities
by Japan, and the awakened stirring of Liberalism
in England herself, and, no matter how feeble its
efforts and how bitter its failure, in Russia, Egypt,
Persia, and Turkey.</p>

<p>Most of these beneficent influences move slowly,
with a deep and gradual force, and, whatever happens,
they will continue to move, though to move slowly.
But the outburst of the new spirit which we call
the unrest in India was occasioned by a different
order of things, for the most part, sudden, external,
and pernicious. Such things were the contemptuous
disregard of Indian feeling in the Partition of Bengal
and Lord Curzon’s University speech upon Indian
mendacity; the exclusion of fully qualified Indians
from public positions, in contradiction to Queen
Victoria’s Proclamation of 1858; several notorious
cases of injustice in the law courts, where English
criminals were involved; numerous instances of
petty persecution for political opinions since 1905;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
the well-known measures for the suppression of
personal liberty and freedom of speech in 1907 and
1908; the espionage of police and postal officials;
and the increasing insolence of the vulgar among
Anglo-Indians, as shown in ordinary behaviour and
in the newspapers which represent their views.</p>

<p>All these obvious and external causes of complaint,
crowded into the space of very few years,
have been sapping India’s confidence in the justice
of our rule and the benevolence of our people.
Indians have, no doubt, exaggerated both the
injustice and the malevolence. They have taken
a few flagrant cases of injustice as typical of our
Courts; they have mistaken for malevolence what
is only our reckless indifference to far-off responsibilities.
But we cannot wonder at their mistakes.
Nearly every one generalizes about foreign nations
from the one or two specimens he knows; and we,
as foreigners in India, must not hope to escape
generalizations rapidly founded on the behaviour of
every man or woman who may represent us there
unworthily. As to our national indifference, I wish
we could say that this charge also was founded only
on special and notorious instances. But it is not.
Our indifference to the Indian peoples, from whom
we are continually sucking so much of our wealth,
is universal and invariable. Or it is varied only
at long intervals after outbreaks of bloodshed and
threatenings of revolt. No wonder that a growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
party in India believes that only by such means can
England’s attention be roused, and any permanent
advantage for their country obtained.</p>

<p>Of course, they are inconsiderate. In spite of
the ill-manners of a certain type of Anglo-Indian,
we are as a whole rather a polite and kind-hearted
people, and the mere shadow of injustice makes us
seethe with indignation, so long as it is not too far
away. If they charge us with indifference, they
ought to consider that we are faced with almost
insoluble problems of our own; that we are a very
busy people, and that our knowledge of what goes
on in India is generally limited to one or two
speeches which attract little attention, a few Parliamentary
questions, and the reports of official or
other journalists whose very existence depends on
standing well with the Anglo-Indian community.
Indians are too apt not to consider these mitigating
circumstances. But it does not tend to make people
considerate when men, women, and children are
dying of a comparatively recent plague by hundreds
of thousands every year; when for fifteen years
in succession famines have been almost regularly
recurrent; when increasing malaria is rotting the
population away in body and mind, and when
thousands, or probably millions, of people who used
to have two meals a day can now afford only one.
I do not say these disasters are the fault of the
Indian Government or the British people. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
is obvious that they do not tend to make the
sufferers under them considerate towards the difficulties
of rulers who hardly suffer from them at all.
They are likely to be the less considerate because
they know that, out of a revenue over which they
have no control, at least £20,000,000 a year is
withdrawn from their country to be spent in England,
partly in the shape of interest on serviceable loans,
but largely in incomes, pensions, and other more
questionable forms; while, even against the better
judgment of the highest Anglo-Indian authorities
themselves, the greatest Indian industry is kept
depressed by the countervailing excise of 3½ per
cent. imposed by the Cotton Duties Act of 1896 on
cottons made and sold in India, simply for the benefit
of our Lancashire mills.</p>

<p>Considerate or not, the new spirit—the section
of it that has time and youth on its side—has begun
to despair of further appeals and petitions for
English justice or assistance. In spite of the
splendid traditions of many noble Englishmen from
Sir Thomas Munro down to Lord Ripon, I suppose
few representatives of our rule have been popular
among the Indian races. That was not usually
the fault of our representatives; their position
made genuine popularity very difficult, and it is
impossible for one race to deny freedom to another
and rule it to the true advantage of either. But I
think that till lately the verdict of most Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
upon us would have been the same as the schoolboy’s
who called Dr. Temple “a beast, but a just beast.”
In their verdict to-day the compliment of that saving
clause would generally be omitted, and that loss of
our high reputation for justice, if it is to be permanent,
is the worst loss we could ever suffer—worst
for ourselves as patriots who honour our
country for her justice, and worst for the Indians,
whose position a sense of permanent injustice will
render intolerable.</p>

<p>The belief that petitions for the redress of
grievances, whether presented to the Indian Government
or to the British people, are equally vain, is
not so serious a matter for us as the distrust of our
justice, but it contributed very strongly to the new
spirit in its extreme form. Our disregard of all the
public protests against the Partition of Bengal and
all the persistent appeals for its withdrawal; our
disregard of the reasonable pleading of such men as
Mr. Gokhale and Dr. Rash Behari Ghose in the
Viceroy’s Council, have perhaps done more than
anything else to discredit the methods of the old
Congress. I do not mean that the Congress has
been useless. It served as a training ground for
political knowledge. It afforded a centre for the
growing unity of India, and without it the leaders
of Indian reform could hardly have formulated their
own programme. But in two avowed objects it has
failed; it has had no influence upon the action of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
the Indian Government, and no influence upon
English opinion at home. For twenty-two years it
was a model of order and constitutional propriety.
It passed excellent resolutions, it demanded the
redress of acknowledged grievances, in trustful
loyalty it arranged deputations to the representatives
of the Crown. By the Anglo-Indians its constitutional
propriety was called cowardice, its resolutions
remained unnoticed, its grievances unredressed,
and the representative of the Crown refused to
receive its deputation. In England, outside the
half-dozen who take some interest in India, no one
knew where the Congress met, what language it
spoke, what were its demands, or what its object;
no one knew, and no one cared.</p>

<p>The new spirit perceived that it was useless
addressing pious resolutions to the official waste-paper
basket. The cry of “self-reliance, not mendicancy”
spread through the country. One last
effort to attract British attention to the grievance of
India was made by the Swadeshi movement and the
boycott on British goods. “Touch the pockets of
our rulers, and they will listen”—that was the hope.
And the hope was partly realized, for owing to
Swadeshi and the local disturbances in Eastern
Bengal, Calcutta, and the Punjab, England during
1907 and 1908 has probably paid more attention to
India than at any time since the Mutiny.</p>

<p>But the principle of Swadeshi has now been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
developed by the new spirit for purposes far beyond
the immediate object proposed. Swadeshi in manufacture
and commerce is now followed for the great
economic purpose of restoring the Indian industries,
threatened or already ruined by England’s favoured
competition. And even this economic Swadeshi is
seen to be only a part of a much wider movement
in self-reliance. On every side societies and orders
are growing up for the promotion of Indian ideals
and the development of Indian character, quite
independently of our influence, and their members
are sometimes inspired by an uncalculating devotion
like that of the early Christians. Such are the Arya
Samaj in the Punjab and United Provinces; the
Servants of India in Poona; the Brahmo Samaj
of highly educated Theists in Calcutta; the Order
of Ramakrishna on the Ganges above Calcutta;
the Hindu College in Benares, with which Mrs.
Annie Besant’s name is so closely connected; the
Order of the Gangrath Institute near Baroda; to say
nothing of the whole Volunteer movement, the
object of which is the renewal of organization,
courage, and physical power among the youth.
None of these movements is political in aim.
Their work as societies lies in social and theological
reform. But both in aim and method all are distinctly
Swadeshi. They take little account of
Government or of the Anglo-Indian community.
In some of them there is even a tendency to react<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
against reform, lest some taint of Western civilization
should be introduced into Indian life. But religious
and social as these movements are in origin and
object, it is no longer possible to exclude their
keener members from politics; for, among educated
people, the events of the last few years have given
to national politics the place once held by theology,
and even social reform cannot now be entirely
separated from political reform, since the result
of educational and other advance is inevitably an
increased demand for self-government.</p>

<p>The question immediately before India now is,
which of two courses with regard to ourselves the
new spirit as a whole will take. On the one hand,
it may follow the line of most resistance. It may
proclaim throughout the whole country: “It is
useless to trouble about any reforms that these
intruding foreigners will give us. Let them go
on their way with their Advisory Councils, their
Notables, their extended Legislative Councils, and
other deceits. They have never paid the smallest
attention to our real demands. In Mill’s words,
they keep us as a warren or preserve for their own
use, a place to make money in, a human farm to be
worked for their own profit. It is for us to pursue
our own course, disregarding their presence. Beyond
paying their taxes, we need have little concern with
them. If they imprison us, we will go to gaol
silently; if they deport us without trial, we will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
endure without protest; if they execute us, we
know that our souls will be at once re-incarnated
to continue the struggle. But we will not notice
their Government either by sharing in it or denouncing
it. In religion, in education, in industries
and common life, we will follow our own national
lines just as though no foreigners were pretending
to rule us. If enough of us combine, we shall
embarrass their position; perhaps we shall make it
untenable as well as ridiculous. But whether it is
untenable or not, we do not greatly care, till a
common Indian nationality has the strength to take
freedom into its own hands.”</p>

<p>That is the line of most resistance, always a
tempting line to take, and many Indians are taking
it now. The temptation must be almost irresistible
in a vast population like India’s, where a handful
of people from a distant country maintain a
predominance unmitigated by social intercourse,
marriage, or permanent residence. All the more
because this predominance rests on so narrow a
basis that for its own maintenance it is inclined to
deter the subject race from all initiative, enterprise,
or leadership, and so to reduce it to what Dadabhai
Naoroji has described as “moral poverty.” Any
movement to check this national deterioration must
be welcomed on behalf of the Indian peoples, except
by those who openly desire those races to remain
as flocks of sheep, dependent on the good nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
or interested bounty of their appointed shepherds.
But that is not the ideal that the best of our statesmen
in India have set before themselves, nor is it
an ideal that can any longer be maintained. The
new spirit has already overthrown it.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>But besides this tempting line of most resistance
there is another way, and, considering the external
dangers that threaten India and her own existing
difficulties of race, religion, and inexperience, this
other way is probably the way of wisdom. The
new spirit may still endeavour to act in harmony
with us for the common good, acquiescing in our
presence as on the whole tending to justice and
advancement, acknowledging the material advantages
we have brought, but at the same time persistently
pressing for extensions of liberty, taking every
opportunity that offers, and never hesitating to grasp
at any chance of progress because it falls short of
the perfect ideal. I admit that to follow this course
requires a sweet reasonableness and a strength of
character which few men in any nation possess.
But after the defeats of many years, Mr. Gokhale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
still retains his hope; and after the outrage upon
his own freedom and the very basis of our liberties,
Lajpat Rai still classes himself with the Moderates.
It depends almost entirely on ourselves whether
those who, in spite of recent disappointments, still
believe in an English feeling for justice and freedom
shall be able to make their voices heard. If only
the more reasonable and hopeful party had something
to point to—some generous and ungrudging act of
justice on England’s part—they might still silence
the counsels of despair. It is not yet too late.
Only, it is no good juggling with sham reforms and
half-hearted concessions. Our measures, as Burke
said, must be remedial.</p>

<p>The nature of such measures is well known.
They should include a modification of the Partition
of Bengal, by which the central province would be
united under one Governor, having the same status
as the Governors of Bombay and Madras, while the
contiguous western districts were collected into a
new province, and Assam remained isolated as it is
by nature and race, under a Chief Commissioner
responsible either to the Viceroy or to the Governor
of Bengal.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> They should include the appointment
of at least one Indian on each of the Executive
Councils (a concession which in the case of the
Viceroy’s Council seems likely to be fulfilled), and
an enlargement of the Viceroy’s and other Legislative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
Councils by genuinely elected members up to the
number of half the Council. This would leave to
the officials a steady but narrow majority, the right
of absolute veto remaining with the Viceroy,
Governor, or Lieutenant-Governor. It might then
be laid down that if a large proportion of the elected
members—say, two-thirds—were opposed to a
certain measure, it should be suspended for further
consideration. Some similar control should be
granted over the expenditure of money, for at
present the representative members have no voice
in the revenue that is scraped off their people year
by year, and the papers of protest or suggestion,
which they read as they sit round the Viceroy’s
council-table, might almost as well remain unread
for any effect they have upon the official policy.</p>

<p>These reforms could be followed by a gradual
extension of primary education, which might in the
end cost us £5,000,000 a year, but would be well
worth the price, even if we had to save something
off the £20,000,000 now spent on the Army, and
something off the other public services. Owing to
our present parsimony in education, the census of
1901 reported that there were 104,500,000 males in
India who could not read, 826 boys out of every
1000 of school age who had no school to go to, and
only 1 in 10 males literate, and 7 in 1000 females.
Further, we could be loyal to the late Queen’s
Proclamation and admit Indians without prejudice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
to the positions they had fitted themselves for. We
could make the position of the police such that they
would be no longer compelled to help out their livelihood
by corruption and false evidence. We could
resolutely extinguish the system of Begar or forced
labour for the benefit of Civilians and other
Europeans. And we could make it illegal for any
representative of our Government to condescend to
the baseness of opening other people’s letters, even
on the off-chance of spying upon sedition.</p>

<em>[Face p. 334.</em><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>Such measures as these would be remedial.
They would serve as an earnest of our country’s
goodwill, and of our determination to maintain the
principles of freedom and justice in our government.
They would cut the ground under the feet of those
who, by proclaiming perpetual distrust of our intentions,
are fostering a fanatical hatred against us.
But I am aware that measures by themselves are
insufficient. What is wanted is the difficult thing
that our fathers called a “change of heart,” and no
legislation can effect that. We need a change that
would transform our people’s arrogance towards
“natives”; a change that would prevent the ladies
and gentlemen whom we send out from degenerating
into “bounders” where Indians are concerned, and
would make it impossible for an Englishman to
display towards Indians the outrageous manners that
would exclude him from decent society at home.
Such a change must be extremely difficult among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>ourselves of the upper and middle classes, for we
are not born very imaginative or sympathetic, we
are educated on a plane of patronizing superiority,
and outside our class and nation any claim to equality
staggers us like a sudden blow. But there are one
or two quite simple points on which we might begin
to practise for the change. Except among the baser
sort of Anglo-Indians, the word “nigger” has died
out, and I would suggest that the word “native”
might follow it. If the phrase “rulers and ruled”
died too, and if our social philosophers would cease
to drone out their weary ineptitude that “East is
East, and West is West,” the situation would be
much eased. I have sometimes thought also that
our reputation would stand higher if English people
who insist, quite rightly, on the importance of our
prestige, were to abstain now and then, for the sake
of our prestige, from games that develop neither
courage nor strength, and are regarded by Indians
with contemptuous astonishment, and from a mode
of dancing which is regarded by Indians as an
indescribable abomination.</p>

<p>But the present crisis is too acute to allow of
waiting for a change of heart. Upon our immediate
action will depend the terms under which we must
maintain our position in India: whether we are to
hold the new spirit fairly on our side, and to cooperate
with it for the progress of the country in
enlightenment and self-government; or whether we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
are to have our rule confronted by impenetrable
resentment, and our best efforts thwarted by indifference
or suspicion. In any case, India has a
long and bitter road to travel. The gulf between
her educated and uneducated classes is wider even
than in our own country. She has many divisions
of thought, and caste, and race to overcome. But,
as to the growth of her new spirit, we need have no
fear. It is one of the most hopeful signs of our
hopeful time. Every act of injustice on our part,
and every attempt at political suppression, have only
promoted India’s sense of unity and hastened her
progress in self-reliance. If injustice and suppression
continue, their effect will be the same. Whatever
course our action may now take, the new spirit has
already breathed a fresh life into large classes of the
Indian peoples, and it will continue to afford a high
motive for self-devotion, and for the moral courage
and love of freedom in which the Indian character
has hitherto been lacking. For India herself the
present unrest holds out a promise of the highest
possibilities, no matter how much she may suffer
in realizing them.</p>

<p>But for us the brief interval left for decision is
momentous. On our decision it will depend whether,
in contempt of the freedom we have with such
obstinate labour secured for ourselves, we shall sink,
step by step, from suppression into persecution, and
from persecution into atrocities that now we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
shudder at; or whether we shall display strength
enough to welcome the spirit of freedom and nationality
which we have done so much to create, and
strength enough to advance with it hand-in-hand for
the furtherance of India’s welfare as a self-respecting
country, and so to redeem our reputation for the
love of a freedom which others may enjoy, as we
enjoy it.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
